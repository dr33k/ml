            "[\"An-Nasir Muhammad (January 17, 1680 - August 23, 1754), was a Yemeni Sayyid who twice claimed the Zaidi imamate of Yemen, in 1723 and 1727-1729\\\\. Muhammad bin Ishaq was a grandson of Imam al-Mahdi Ahmad (died 1681). In 1723, while staying in Mashriq, he proclaimed his da'wah (call for the imamate) under the name an-Nasir Muhammad. The proclamation was done in opposition to the current Imam al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim. However, a well-known man of letters, Muhammad bin Isma'il al-Amir, managed to bring about a reconciliation. When al- Mutawakkil al-Qasim died in 1727, an-Nasir Muhammad once again claimed the imamate from his base in Zafar, north-west of San'a.

He was opposed by the deceased Imam's son al-Mansur al-Husayn II who held San'a. The leader of the tribesmen went to parley with al-Mansur al-Husayn but was assassinated in the latter's tent. This led to great consternation among the tribes and a round of indecisive fighting. For a brief time al-Mansur al- Husayn appears to have acknowledged an-Nasir Muhammad as Imam. Later, however, he captured the sons of an-Nasir Muhammad, and the Imam came to his opponent's court in about 1729 to do homage. He was well received, and al-Mansur al- Husayn assigned maintenance for him. One of an-Nasir Muhammad's sons stayed in confinement, while he himself withdrew to private life until his death in 1754.R. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian islamic City.

Formerly the Carol Remmer Angle Distinguished Professor of Children\\'s Environmental Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she is now Sara & Charles Ayres Distinguished Professor in the Department of Statistical Science, Global Health Institute, and Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics of Duke University. ==Education and career== Herring graduated summa cum laude from the University of Mississippi in 1995, with a double major in English and mathematics. She completed an Sc.D in biostatistics at Harvard University in 2000; her dissertation, supervised by Joseph G. Ibrahim, was Missing Covariates in Survival Analysis. She joined the North Carolina faculty in 2000, where she became a fellow of the Carolina Population Center in 2006 and Carol Remmer Angle Distinguished Professor of Children\\'s Environmental Health in 2015. She moved to Duke in 2017 as part of a hiring initiative to expand Duke\\'s faculty in the quantitative sciences. ==Research== Herring has authored over 275 papers with a focus on statistical methods for correlated data, including longitudinal data and mixed-scale multivariate data. She collaborates extensively with researchers in reproductive, environmental, and global health. In 2013, a longitudinal study led by Herring and colleagues and published in the British Medical Journal compared the dates of childbirth and of first intercourse reported in separate questions by a sample of American women, and determined that according to this data one out of every 200 women in the US reported dates consistent with giving virgin birth. Herring stated that she found it \"highly unlikely\" that these women believed themselves to be virgins at the time of their children\\'s births, and suggested that the result might instead be a combination of unintentional inaccuracies by the subjects and of respondents being unwilling to admit to having intercourse. ==Awards and honors== In 2010, Herring was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. She won the Gertrude M. Cox Award for outstanding contributions to applied statistics in 2012. In the same year, the American Public Health Association gave her their Mortimer Spiegelman Award. She won the 2018 Lagakos Distinguished Alumni Award from Harvard University Department of Biostatistics and the 2019 Janet L.

            " 'An Unkindness of Ghosts is a 2017 science fiction novel by Rivers Solomon, exploring the conjunction between structural racism and generation ships. Solomon\\'s first book, it was published by Akashic Books. ==Synopsis== On board the generation ship Matilda (named for the Clotilda), where the passengers have formed a society stratified along racial lines such that those with dark skin are relegated to lower-deck lives of servitude and harsh behavioral restrictions, Aster Gray is a lower-decks healer who must discover the hidden connection between her mother\\'s suicide decades ago and the mysterious death of the ship\\'s Sovereign. ==Reception== An Unkindness of Ghosts was a finalist for the 30th Lambda Literary Award for Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, and led to Solomon being shortlisted for the 2018 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. Kirkus Reviews considered the book \"entertaining\", calling the Matilda a \"well-crafted world\" and noting that the \"refreshingly visible and vital\" diversity of its population lessens the extent to which the dictatorial Sovereignty \"feels like a familiar dystopic trope.\" Publishers Weekly called it \"stunning\", but stated that the \"worldbuilding by poetry\" and \"many layers of metaphor\" may disappoint readers seeking hard science fiction. In Locus, Gary K. Wolfe commended Solomon\\'s depiction of shipboard society as \"sharply detailed and viscerally realized\", with \"characters so closely observed\" and \"individual scenes so tightly structured\" that the book \"achieves surprising power and occasional brilliance\", and underlined Aster\\'s \"Heinleinesque\" competence. At National Public Radio, Amal El-Mohtar lauded Solomon\\'s use of different dialects on each deck of the Matilda, and conceded that —although she \"loved the book for what it did to (her)\" and \"for having made (her) feel stronger and more sure in a nightmare world\" — it is \"not a happy book\". Strange Horizons observed that the book\\'s \"Afrofuturist premise\" is shaped by its \"queer neuroatypical worldview\" in that \"all of the central characters are both gender-variant and neurodivergent\", emphasizing that Aster\\'s inability to understand figurative language and deception — and subsequent insistence on clear and unambiguous communication — \"disrupts some of the more expected tropes of SF adventure narratives.\" ==References== == External links == * An Unkindness of Ghosts on Akashic Books Category:2017 American novels Category:2017 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Generation ships in fiction Category:Akashic Books books Category:2017 debut novels Category:Afrofuturist novels'\n",

The high nickel and molybdenum contents of the AL-6XN alloy give it good resistance to chloride stress-corrosion cracking. The molybdenum confers resistance to chloride pitting. The nitrogen content serves to further increase pitting resistance and also gives it higher strength than typical 300 series austenitic stainless steels, and thereby often allows it to be used in thinner sections. This metal is commonly used instead of 300 series stainless steels in high temperature and low pH applications in food processing. For example, tomato juice will corrode 316L stainless steel at pasteurization temperatures of 210 °F (100 °C).

            " 'Amir Sjarifuddin Harahap (EVO: Amir Sjarifoeddin Harahap; 27 April 1907 – 19 December 1948) was an Indonesian politician and journalist who served as the second prime minister of Indonesia from 1947 until 1948. A major leader of the left-wing during the Indonesian National Revolution, he previously served as Minister of Information from 1945 until 1946 and Minister of Defense from 1945 until 1948. Amir was born into the Sumatran aristocracy, and was educated at Leiden University. At Leiden, he became a member of the board of the Gymnasium student association in Haarlem, and was involved in the Batak student organization Jong Batak. He returned to Indonesia due to family troubles, but continued his education at the Rechts Hogeschool in Batavia. After graduating, he became active in literary and journalist circles, joining the editorial board of the newspaper Panorama. He also became involved with left-wing politics, and led a group of younger Marxists in the establishment of the Indonesian People\\'s Movement (Gerindo). In 1933, due to his political activities, Amir was imprisoned, and almost exiled to the Boven-Digoel concentration camp, had it not for the efforts of his cousin and teacher. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Amir was one of a few prominent Indonesian politicians who actively fought against the Japanese, together with fellow future-Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir. Following the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, he was appointed Minister of Information in President Sukarno\\'s Presidential Cabinet. Later, he was appointed the Minister of Defense following the absence of Supriyadi. After the fall of Sjahrir\\'s cabinet, Amir was chosen to head the new cabinet, with the backing of a broad coalition. He faced a backlash over the cabinet\\'s decision to ratify the Renville Agreement, and he resigned from the prime ministership, being succeeded by Vice President Mohammad Hatta as prime minister. After his ousting, he became involved in the People\\'s Democratic Front (FDR). Following the beginning of the Madiun Affair, Amir and other FDR leaders rushed to assume control of the newly formed \"National Front\" government. In the following weeks, pro-government forces, led by the Siliwangi Division, began pushing the leftists forces back. During the fighting, Amir was captured, and imprisoned in Yogyakarta. After the withdrawal of Republican forces after Operation Kraai, he was executed, along with fifty other leftist prisoners. == Early life == Amir Sjarifuddin Harahap was born in Medan, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), on 27 April 1907. He was born into the Sumatran aristocracy. His grandfather, Mangaraja Monang, was a Batak nobleman – who had been baptized into Christianity and named Ephraim – with the title of Sutan Gunung Tua. Amir\\'s father, Djamin, was also a noblemen, with the title of Sultan Soripada Harahap, however he later left the religion and became a Muslim, after marrying Amir\\'s mother, Basunu Siregar, a devout Muslim woman who came from a well-respected family from the Malay- Islamic community. Amir was the eldest child of seven children, and was given the title of Sutan Gunung Sualoon. He came from a family of prosecutors, with both his grandfather and father practicing the profession. Amir began his education in 1914, when he attended the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS) in Medan. However, in 1916, he was forced to attend a different ELS in Sibolga, as his father was transferred there. In August 1921, he and his older cousin, Todung Sutan Gunung Mulia, left for the Netherlands. There, he resided with the Smink family in Haarlem, 29 kilometers north of Leiden. He continued his education to the Gymnasium in Haarlem, though Mulia returned to Indonesia, as he had completed his schooling already. After only a year at the Haarlem Gymnasium, he moved to the State Gymnasium of Leiden. In Leiden, Amir stayed at the house of Mrs. Antonie Aris van de Losdrecht–Sizzo, a widow of the evangelist and missionary Antonie Aris van de Loosdrecht, who was killed in Tana Toraja in 1913. He became involved in the Batak student organization Jong Batak, and was becoming increasingly interested in Christianity and the Bible. As a student, he would become a member of the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (\"Indonesian Association\"), under the leadership of future-Indonesian vice president Mohammad Hatta. During his time in Leiden, he began to be admire and be influenced by the Count of Mirebeau, Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, and Maximillien Robespierre, both of whom would influence Amir in his later career. He returned to Indonesia following family troubles, as his father had lost his job as Chief Prosecutor because he punched a prisoner. He would continue his education at the Rechts Hogeschool, and later converted from Islam to Christianity in 1931, being baptized in the Huria Church, in Batavia. He would go on to give sermons at the church. == Journalism and World War II == Throughout the 1930s, Amir was active in literary and journalistic circles, joining the editorial board of the newspaper Panorama, together with Liem Koen Hian, Sanusi Pane and Mohammad Yamin. In 1933, Amir was imprisoned by the Dutch for his Aksi Massa (\"Mass Action\") essay, an essay published in the Banteng Partindo magazine which encouraged the public to drive out the colonial invaders. Though in actuality, the essay was written by Mohammad Yamin, with Amir only stated as the author in the published version. Amir was imprisoned for two years, being released on 5 June 1935. In mid-1936, together with his colleagues Liem, Pane and Yamin, Amir started another newspaper, Kebangoenan, which – as with Panorama – was published by Phoa Liong Gie\\'s Siang Po Printing Press. In 1937, towards the end of the Dutch rule, Amir led a group of younger Marxists in the establishment of Indonesian People\\'s Movement (Gerindo). Under Amir\\'s leadership, the party was considered a radical leftist anti-fascist political party, influenced by the ideology of Communism. The Soviet Union\\'s Dimitrov doctrine, had called for a common front against fascism which helped swell the number of Indonesians taking a cooperative approach with regards to the Dutch colonial administration in an attempt to secure Indonesian independence. Gerindo was one of the more significant cooperative parties in the years leading to World War II whose objectives included a fully Indonesian legislature; It had modest goals in comparison to the Dutch-suppressed radical nationalists led by the likes of Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, who Sjarifuddin had met before the War. By 1940, Dutch intelligence suspected him of being involved with the Communist underground. Having watched the increased strength and influence of Imperial Japan, he was one of a number of Indonesian leaders who warned against the danger of fascism before the war. Prior to the German invasion of the Netherlands, Amir himself led and promoted boycotts against trade with Japan. When the colony was invaded by Japan, his prominent role in these campaigns prompted the head of Dutch intelligence to provide Amir with 25,000 guilders to organize an underground resistance movement. Upon Japan\\'s occupation of the East Indies, the Japanese enforced total suppression of any opposition to their rule. Most Indonesian leaders obliged either by becoming \\'neutral observers\\' or by actively cooperating. Amir was one of a few prominent Indonesian politicians who actively fought against the Japanese, together with fellow future-Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir. The Japanese arrested Sjarifuddin in 1943, and he escaped execution only due to intervention from Sukarno, whose popularity in Indonesia – and hence importance to the war effort – was recognized by the Japanese. By 1945, Amir had become known and respected as a politician. And although he had been in contact with the \\'illegal\\' Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), he had nothing but disdain for the \\'unsophisticated\\' and unknown Marxists who re-established the party in 1935. His closest colleagues were from the \\'illegal PKI\\' underground and the pre-war Indonesian People\\'s Movement (Gerindo). Together, they formed the Socialist Party of Indonesia (Parsi) on 1 November 1945. At a two-party conference on 16 – 17 December it was announced that Amir\\'s Parsi would merge with Sjahrir\\'s political grouping, the Socialist People\\'s Party (Paras), forming the Socialist Party (PS). With Sjahrir serving as chairman, and Amir serving as vice chairman. The Socialist Party quickly became the strongest pro-government party, especially in Yogyakarta and East Java. The party accepted the argument of Amir and its other leaders that the time was not ripe to implement socialism, rather that international support necessary for independence be sought, and that unruly constituents had to be opposed. The party\\'s westernized leaders showed more faith in Netherlands left-wing forces, than in the revolutionary fervor of the Indonesian people, which became a source of discontent among the party\\'s opponents. == National Revolution == === Cabinet Minister === Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 and the proclamation of Indonesian independence two days later, the Republic announced its first ministry on 4 September. The seventeen-member cabinet was composed mostly of \\'collaborating\\' nationalists; Amir was appointed Information Minister under the new cabinet, though at the time his fate was unknown, as he was then imprisoned by the Japanese. He was eventually released on 1 October 1945, and took office shortly after. Amir\\'s appointment as minister of information was likely due to his background in journalism prior to World War II. Early in the Revolution, Amir worked closely with the country\\'s first Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir; the two played the major role in shaping the arrangements linking the new government of Indonesia with its people remarkably effectively. On 30 October Amir, along with Sukarno and Hatta, were flown into the East Javan city of Surabaya by the desperate British caretaker administration. The three were seen as the only Indonesian leaders likely able to quell fighting between Republican and British Indian forces in which the British Brigade were hopelessly outnumbered and facing annihilation. A ceasefire was immediately adhered to, but fighting resumed after confused communications and mistrust between the two sides, leading to the Battle of Surabaya. On 16 October 1945, Sjahrir and Amir took control of the Central Indonesian National Committee, and following the 11 November transition to parliamentary government, Amir was appointed to a new cabinet with Sjahrir as Prime Minister. President Sukarno accepted a proposal for cabinet to answer to the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) acting as Parliament rather than to the President. This watershed event ushered in the so-called \\'liberal\\' or parliamentary form of government, which prevailed against the Sukarnoist- proposed constitution for twelve years. Leadership was thus handed to a \\'modernizing\\' Western-minded intellectual, who at the time were thought to be the coming leaders of Asia and more palatable to Western ideas of government. When considered against previous forms of government — indigenous Indonesian, Dutch, Japanese and even the first brief Republican government — this was the most revolutionary political change at a national level during the National Revolution. Amir left the position of Information Minister on 4 January 1946, and was replaced by Mohammad Natsir. Instead, he became the Minister of Defense. His main task as minister was to make the army an \"effective and responsible tool of government policy\". His position as minister, however, was a source of friction with the People\\'s Security Force (TKR) and its new commander, Sudirman, who had nominated their own candidate, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta. However, the Sultan was not eager to contest the position. Amir was a central figure in the government\\'s \\'anti-fascist\\' programme with the army a key target, which caused further frictions. Sjahrir attacked PETA-trained army officers as \\'traitors\\', \\'fascists\\', and \\'running dogs\\' who had cooperated with the Japanese. Amir promoted the Red Army as a model of a citizens\\' army loyal to the government and holding socialist ideals. On 19 February 1946, Amir inaugurated a socialist and Masyumi politician-dominated \\'education staff\\' for the army. The body appointed fifty- five \\'political officers\\' at the end of May without consulting the army command. These new officers were to educate each TRI unit in the goals of the revolution. He was not, however, able to effectively impose such ideals on unit commanders, particularly as Sudirman and other PETA-trained resented the \\'fascist\\' slur cast on them. The Marxist\\'s overtones of Amir\\'s new military academies conflicted with the popular army view of being above politics and the need to play a unifying role in the national struggle; the army leadership consequently rejected attempts to introduce partisan ideology and alignments. This antagonism between the government and PETA-trained officers, forced Amir to find an armed support base elsewhere. He aligned himself with sympathetic Dutch-educated officers in certain divisions, such as the West Java \\'Siliwangi\\' Division the command of which had been assumed by KNIL Lieutenant A.H. Nasution in May 1946. Another source of support for the new cabinet was the more educated armed pemuda sympathetic to the cabinet\\'s \\'anti-fascist\\' approach. With an engaging personality and persuasive oratory skills, Amir had more time and aptitude than Sjahrir for party building, and he played the main part in wooing these pemuda. === Prime Minister === A split between Amir\\'s and Prime Minister Sjahrir\\'s supporters rapidly deepened in 1947. There had long been mutual suspicion between Sjahrir and the communists who had returned from the Netherlands in 1946; the fading of the \\'anti-fascist\\' cause made these suspicions more obvious. Sjahrir\\'s preoccupation with diplomacy, his physical isolation in Jakarta from revolution-infused Central Java, and his dislike of mass rallies allowed the more Moscow-inclined Marxists to assume more control in both the Socialist Party and the Left-wing as a whole. By June 1946, Sjahrir\\'s increasing isolation from the coalition encouraged the opposing factions to depose him. This group put their support behind Amir, the alternative Socialist leader. On 26 June 1947, Amir, along with two other Moscow-inclined Ministers Abdulmadjid Djojoadiningrat, and Wikana, backed by a majority of the left, withdrew their support for Sjahrir. Their argument was that Sjahrir had compromised the Republic in his pursuit of diplomacy – the same charge that deposed every revolutionary government – and that in the face of Dutch belligerence, such conciliation seemed futile. Following the resignation of Sjahrir as prime minister, a new government needed to be formed. On 30 June 1947, President Sukarno appointed Amir, Adnan Kapau Gani, Soekiman Wirjosandjojo, and Setyadjit Soegondo to form a new cabinet. During these negotiations, Amir courted a broad coalition but hostility from Muslim Masyumi prevented its leader, Soekiman, as well many pro-Sjahrir \\'religious socialists\\' from previous cabinets from joining the new cabinet. Other influential Masyumi factions, such as that of Wondoamiseno, provided support. Although Amir\\'s communist allies controlled about 10% of the thirty-four with Amir\\'s Defence Ministry their sole key one, this cabinet was the highest point of orthodox communist influence in the Revolution. On 3 July 1947, Amir was inaugurated as prime minister, alongside his cabinet, which would be known as the First Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet. He would also continue to serve as minister concurrently. There were rumors about Amir\\'s appointment as prime minister, based on the consideration that he would be needed in negotiations with the Dutch. In running the government, he appointed Adnan Kapau Gani as his de facto confidant in dealing with foreign affairs. Following a backlash over the Renville Agreement, for which Amir received much of the blame, PNI and Masyumi cabinet members resigned in early January 1948. On 23 January, with his support base disappearing, Amir resigned from the prime ministership. == Madiun affair and death == left|thumb|Amir Sjarifuddin (wearing glasses), after being detained by the Indonesian military, Following the fall of his second cabinet, on 26 January 1948, a new cabinet was formed, which was headed by Vice President Mohammad Hatta. Opposition to the Hatta Cabinet coalesced into a new organization, known as the People\\'s Democratic Front, which began holding demonstrations, demanding the return of Amir in the Cabinet and as Minister of Defense. Amir joined the fold, and heavily criticized Hatta and his cabinet, labelling it as the \"Masyumi Cabinet\", as it was dominated by members of the Islamic Masyumi Party. Meanwhile, other leftist parties and organizations supporting the government joined in an opposing organization, known as the People\\'s Revolutionary Movement (GGR). However, Amir\\'s efforts to overthrow the Hatta Cabinet were in vain, as the Hatta Cabinet continued along with its four main programs. Over the following months, the political situation remained tense, while the economic situation increasingly deteriorated, and relations with the Dutch, after the Renville Agreement did not appear to be getting better. In August 1948, Musso, the 1920s leader of the PKI, arrived in Yogyakarta from his exile in the Soviet Union. Amir and the leadership of the People\\'s Democratic Front immediately accepted his authority, and Amir admitted membership of the underground PKI since 1935. Adhering to Musso\\'s Stalinist thinking of a single party of the working class, the major leftist parties in the Front dissolved themselves into the PKI. Meanwhile, worker strikes were held in Delanggu, Surakarta. The strikes escalated into demonstrations, between communist and pro-government forces, before increasing rapidly into full on open warfare. On 18 September 1948, a group of PKI supporters took over strategic points in the Madiun area in what would come to be known as the Madiun Affair. They killed pro-government officers, and announced over radio the formation of a new \"National Front\" government. Caught by surprise by the premature coup attempt, Communist leaders, including Amir, rushed to Madiun to take charge of the government. The following day, about 200 pro-PKI and other leftist leaders who remained in Yogyakarta were arrested by the Republican government, with Sukarno denouncing the Madiun rebels over radio, and calling upon Indonesians to rally against Musso and his plans for a Soviet-style government. Musso replied on radio that he would fight to the finish, while, the People\\'s Democratic Front branches in Banten and Sumatra announced they had nothing to do with the rebellion. In the following weeks, pro-government forces, led by the Siliwangi Division, marched on Madiun where there were an estimated 5,000-10,000 pro-PKI soldiers. As the rebels retreated they killed Masyumi and PNI leaders and officials, and in the villages killings took place along santri-abangan lines. On 30 September, the rebels abandoned Madiun, and were pursued by pro-government troops through the countryside. Musso was killed on 31 October trying to escape custody. Amir and 300 rebel soldiers were captured by Siliwangi troops on 1 December. Some 35,000 people were later arrested. It is thought perhaps 8,000 people were killed in the affair. As part of a second major military offensive against the Republic, on 19 December Dutch troops occupied Yogyakarta city and the Republican government was captured, including Sukarno, Hatta, Agus Salim, and Sjahrir. Republican forces withdraw to the countryside beginning full-scale guerrilla war on either side of the van Mook line. Rather than risk their release, the army killed Amir and fifty other leftist prisoners as it withdrew from Yogyakarta that evening. == See also == * First Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet * Second Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet * Madiun Affair == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Sources === * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1907 births Category:1948 deaths Category:People from Medan Category:Prime Ministers of Indonesia Category:People of Batak descent Category:Converts to Protestantism from Islam Category:People of the Indonesian National Revolution Category:Indonesian Protestants Category:Indonesian former Muslims Category:Socialist Party of Indonesia politicians Category:Defense ministers of Indonesia Category:Indonesian Christians Category:Christian communists Category:Indonesian Christian socialists Category:Indonesian newspaper editors Category:Newspaper editors from the Dutch East Indies Category:Rechtshogeschool te Batavia alumni Category:Executed Indonesian people Category:Executed prime ministers'\n",
            " 'Absolute Beginners is a novel by Colin MacInnes, written and set in 1958 London, England. It was published in 1959. The novel is the second of MacInnes\\' London Trilogy, coming after City of Spades (1958) and before Mr. Love and Justice (1960). These novels are each self-contained, with no shared characters. ==Introduction== The novel is written from the first-person perspective of a teenage freelance photographer, who lives in a rundown yet vibrant part of West London he calls Napoli. The area is home to a large number of Caribbean immigrants, as well as English people on the margins of society, such as homosexuals and drug addicts. The themes of the novel are the narrator\\'s opinions on the newly formed youth culture and its fixation on clothes and jazz music, his love for his ex-girlfriend Crêpe Suzette, the illness of his father, and simmering racial tensions in the summer of the Notting Hill race riots. ==Plot summary== The novel is divided into four sections. Each details a particular day in the four months that spanned the summer of 1958. In June takes up half of the book and shows the narrator meeting up with various teenaged friends and some adults in various parts of London and discussing his outlook on life and the new concept of being a teenager. He also learns that his ex-girlfriend, Suzette, is to enter a marriage of convenience with her boss, a middle-aged gay fashion designer called Henley. In July has the narrator taking photographs by the river Thames, seeing the musical operetta H.M.S. Pinafore with his father, has a violent encounter with Ed the Ted and watches Hoplite\\'s appearance on Call-Me- Cobber\\'s TV show. In August has the narrator and his father take a cruise along the Thames towards Windsor Castle. His father is taken ill on the trip and has to be taken to a doctor. The narrator also finds Suzette at her husband\\'s cottage in Cookham. In September is set on the narrator\\'s 19th birthday. He sees this, symbolically, as the beginning of his last year as a teenager. He witnesses several incidents of racial violence, which disgust him. His father also dies, leaving him four envelopes stuffed with money. Suzette has separated from Henley, but still seems uncertain as to whether she should resume her relationship with the narrator. The narrator decides to leave the country and find a place where racism doesn\\'t exist. At the airport, he sees Africans arriving and gives them a warm welcome. ==Characters== * The narrator (Blitz Baby)– a teenage photographer who lives in an attic flat in a building in London\\'s W10 area; he makes most of his money by selling pornographic pictures, but is interested in having an exhibition of his other work. The name \"Blitz Baby\" was given to him by his mother, since he was born in a bunker during a blitz bombing. * Crêpe Suzette – the narrator\\'s ex- girlfriend who behaves promiscuously and who intends to enter into a sexless marriage with her boss. * The narrator\\'s parents – His mother runs a boarding house and prefers the company of her boarders to that of her second husband, the narrator\\'s father. She has a stormy relationship with the narrator, who keeps a photographic darkroom at the house as an excuse to visit his father. His father has been writing a book called The History of Pimlico for several years. * The Fabulous Hoplite – An occasional rentboy and part of the Knightsbridge-Chelsea set, who lives in the same building as the narrator. * The Wizard – best friend of the narrator, a baby-faced sociopath who works as a pimp, and after a falling out, joins with the racist thugs during the riots. * Henley – a gay fashion designer who claims to be 45 and who intends to marry Suzette. * Verne – the 25-year-old half-brother of the narrator. He and the narrator do not have a great relationship, since they do not share the same ideals and butt heads about it. * Mr. Cool – a young mixed-race man, born in London, who lives in the same building as the narrator and who is threatened by the local teddy boys to leave the area. * Wilf – Mr. Cool\\'s white half- brother. * Call-me-Cobber – an Australian media celebrity and presenter of the ITV chat show Junction! * The ex-Deb-of-Last-Year – a young, upper-class female friend of the narrator, who goes out with Call-me-Cobber. * Ed the Ted – a pasty-faced teddy boy who has left his old gang and became part of a mob of racist hooligans. * Zesty-Boy Swift – an unsuccessful pop singer who became a highly successful songwriter. * Dido Lament – a gossip columnist. * Big Jill – a lesbian in her 20s who lives in the basement flat of the narrator\\'s building and who controls young, lesbian prostitutes. * Dean Swift – one of the narrator\\'s pornographic models, a junkie, and a lover of modern jazz. * The Misery Kid – a devotee of old-style jazz. * Mannie Katz – a poet friend of the narrator; married to Miriam and father of Saul. * Vendice Partners – Dido\\'s ex-lover who works at a Mayfair-based advertising agency. The narrator also encounters a left-wing trade unionist called \\'Ron Todd\\' in a jazz club. In 1985 a real-life trade unionist called Ron Todd became general secretary of the TGWU. ==Style== Although MacInnes turned 44 in the summer of 1958, the book is written through the eyes of an 18-year-old, who is part of the new vibrant and affluent London youth culture of coffee bars, modern jazz and rock \\'n\\' roll music, and Italian scooters and clothes. As such, it chronicles the first years of what would become the mod subculture in the 1960s. MacInnes has the narrator use a very stylised form of speech. For example, when the narrator and Zesty-Boy talk about why Vendice no longer uses Dido\\'s newspaper for advertising, MacInnes writes it as: > \"And why has Partner\\'s pimpery taken their custom away from Dido\\'s toilet- > paper daily?\" I asked Zesty-Boy. > \"It may be that Dido\\'s slipping, or the paper\\'s slipping, or just that > everything these days is falling in the fat laps of the jingle kings.\" > \"I wonder why Dido doesn\\'t do a quick change and crash land in the telly > casbah?\" The narrator is never given a name. When asked it by a girl at a party, he avoids the question. When pressed, he says, sarcastically, David Copperfield. He is variously addressed in the book as \"blitz baby\", \"kid\", \"teenager\", \"child\", \"infant prodigy\" and \"son\": all terms that emphasise his youth. The majority of the other characters are given nicknames or referred to by their job titles, rather than by their real names. ==Film adaptation== The novel was adapted into a musical film directed by Julien Temple and released in 1986. Retrieved 2 March 2005. The narrator was given the name Colin, after Colin MacInnes, and was played by Eddie O\\'Connell. Patsy Kensit played Crêpe Suzette and David Bowie appeared as advertising man Vendice Partners. Bowie also wrote and performed the title song, which reached number 2 in the UK singles chart in March 1986. The film used many of the characters of the book, but changed a lot of their motivations and the story\\'s ending. It also made more use of the idea of older characters exploiting the young, which was merely hinted at in the novel. The novel was republished by Penguin Books to tie in with the film\\'s release. The cover showed O\\'Connell and Kensit in front of a stylised silhouette of the London skyline. ==Paul Weller== The singer-songwriter Paul Weller, who was born in 1958, has described the novel as \"a book of inspiration\". This quote was used on the cover of the 1986 paperback edition. Weller also chose the book when he appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs. His group The Jam released a single called \"Absolute Beginners\" in 1981. It reached number 4 in the UK charts. His second band, The Style Council, recorded the song \"Have You Ever Had It Blue?\" for the 1986 film. ==Release details== * 1959, UK, MacGibbon & Kee, 1959, unknown binding * 1960, USA, Macmillan Publishers, 1960, hardcover * 1961, USA, Ace Books, 1961, paperback * 1966, UK, Hutchinson Educational (), February 1966, hardcover * 1970, UK, Ballantine Books (), 12 April 1970, paperback * 1973, UK, Panther (), Pub date 29 November 1973, paperback * 1980, UK, Allison & Busby (), March 1980, hardcover * 1980, UK, Allison & Busby (), March 1980, paperback * 1980, UK, Schocken Books (), September 1980, hardcover * 1985, UK, E.

            " 'thumb|200px|Antonín Wiehl (1880s) Antonín Wiehl (26 April 1846, Plasy – 4 November 1910, Prague) was a Czech architect, museum official, and patron of the arts. He helped create the first system of historic preservation in Bohemia. == Biography == His father was an Austrian forestry official, assigned to the estates of Klemens von Metternich. He attended the Realschule in Plzeň, then received his secondary education in Prague. From 1863 to 1868, he was enrolled at the Polytechnic. He began his civil engineering course with Professor , who retired in 1864, then continued with Josef Zítek. From 1869 to 1870, he was in Slatiňany, working for a construction company owned by the architect, , who did restorations and was a regional conservator for the Vienna Central Commission that oversaw the preservation of monuments. During Wiehl\\'s time with the company, he gained invaluable experience doing restorative work on a number of churches. Following his employment there, he returned to the Polytechnic and was an assistant to Professor Josef Niklas until 1873. After that, he took an extended study trip to Italy; what would be the first of many such trips throughout his career. Upon returning, he opened his own architectural practice. In 1876, he married Maria Lukasová, from Slaný. Their marriage would remain childless. From 1881, he was a member of the founding committee for the City of Prague Museum. He also drafted a design for the museum, which was not chosen. In 1883, he became the first Chairman of the Association of Engineers and Architects. He was also a member of the , where he sat on the archaeological commission, and was involved in the study of museology. In 1891, he made trips to the Bohemian countryside, preparing his folk-motif concepts for a pavilion at the General Land Centennial Exhibition. The architect, , and the writer, Alois Jirásek, worked with him to create the project. Although it received praise from the critics in Prague, visitors from the countryside were less impressed. The writer, Svatopluk Čech, satirized it in one of his novels. From 1892, he focused on designing rental homes and conservation; serving on a committee dedicated to identifying historical architectural elements and transferring them to museums, during a period of redevelopment known as the \"\", that resulted in the demolition of many old neighborhoods. As he grew older, he became increasingly deaf, and gradually retired from active work; devoting himself instead to gardening, collecting art and antiques, and pursuing his lifelong interests. He also worked on developing ideas for what he called the \"Institute of National Economy\". His will included numerous endowments for scientific, technical and educational organizations. His home was bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences and Arts. Since 1953, they have used it for their bookstore and publishing division, . He also donated some of his property for the establishment of his proposed Institute. His art collection, books and photographs were given to various museums. He is buried in a tomb of his own design at Vyšehrad Cemetery. His sculptural models and sketches were donated to the National Museum by his widow Maria. thumb|300px|The Wiehl House == Sources == * Kateřina Boháčová, \"Antonín Wiehl a jeho pražské novorenesanční stavby\" (Antonín Wiehl and his neo-renaissance buildings in Prague), in: Stavba, Vol.18, #3, 2011, pp. 69 - 71 * Irena Bukačová, Antonín Wiehl, City of PLasy, 2010, * Milan Kašpar, Alena Michálková, \"Architekt Antonín Wiehl, tvůrce a představitel české neorenesance (1846–1910)\" (Architect Antonín Wiehl, creator and representative of the Czech Neo-Renaissance) @ Stavebnictvi3000 * Markéta Kudláčová, \"Architekt souladu: Antonín Wiehl a jeho cesta k české renesanci\" (Antonín Wiehl and his journey to the Czech Renaissance) @ Dějiny a současnost * Pavel Vlček, Věra Naňková; Vítovský, \"Antonín Wiehl\", In: Encyklopedie architektů, stavitelů, zedníků a kameníků v Čechách, Jaroslav Havel, Běla Trpišovská (Eds.), Academia, 2004 pp. 712-713 * Jindřich Vybírla. \"Česká versus italská neorenesanãní vila: Antonín Wiehl, Antonín Barvitius a jejich mecenáši\" (\"Czech\" versus \"Italian\" Neo-Renaissance villa.

            " 'upright|thumb|2017 Anthem Christmas tree The Anthem Christmas tree is a Christmas tree erected annually at the Outlets North Phoenix, an outlet mall in Anthem, Arizona, approximately north of downtown Phoenix. The mall\\'s tree is the tallest Christmas tree in the state of Arizona every year, and is often listed as the tallest Christmas tree in the United States. ==Background== The mall has been displaying a tall tree since 2002. At some point during the 2000s, the tree began setting the record for Arizona\\'s tallest fresh-cut Christmas tree, with heights exceeding . In 2010, a white pine was installed, giving the Anthem tree its first title of tallest fresh-cut Christmas tree in the United States. The marketing director at the mall said in 2012 that the tree draws customers from around the state as well as brings national attention. ==Origin and installation== upright|thumb|2014 Anthem Christmas tree The tree is harvested annually near McCloud, in the Shasta–Trinity National Forest in northern California, from a family-run tree farm. These pine trees do not naturally have live branches on the bottom portion due to the lack of sunlight reaching the ground, therefore the tree does not have the triangular shape of a traditional Christmas tree. The bottom portion of the trunk is shaped with the addition of small trees of the same species, which are used to make artificial branches. These \"branches\" are attached to the trunk by being grafted into cut notches, filling in the lower part of the tree and creating a more pleasing aesthetic look. Up to 1,000 live branches are used, ranging from in length, to give the tree its final shape. In 2018, 25 saplings were planted to replenish the area from which the tree was harvested. About fifty pine cones from the 2014 tree were used to replant other trees. In some years, there is a \"twin\" of similar size at the mall\\'s \"sister\" property, Citadel Outlets in Los Angeles, California. A trucking company that specializes in heavy or oversize loads then hauls the tree approximately over four days on an extended length semi-trailer. The tree travels south through Shasta, Sacramento, and Los Angeles before heading into the desert and across the Arizona border on an open flatbed trailer with a banner that reads \"Follow me to Outlets at Anthem Largest Tree in Arizona\". Upon arriving in Anthem, the tree is placed in a well filled with water that keeps the tree from drying out until January. It is also sprayed with over of fire retardant. ==Lighting ceremony== A crew of ten to twelve people working eight-hour days for several weeks decorate the tree with 5,000 ornaments and bows, and 80 strands of LED Christmas lights that cumulatively measure in length. The ornaments measure and the tree is topped with a , copper star. The copper star represents Arizona\\'s copper heritage, as the state has mined more copper than any other state since 1907 and was nicknamed \"The Copper State\" at statehood in 1912. The installation and decoration begins in late October and a tree-lighting ceremony is held in mid-November. The ceremony includes live music and \"holiday treats\" at the \"family fun night\", the highlight of which is the illumination of the tree for the first time. The live entertainment in 2018 included performances by AJ Mitchell and the All-American Boys Chorus from Los Angeles. Country singer Maggie Rose performed in 2015. The 2019 display includes an interactive light show in which lights on the tree and on the roofline of surrounding buildings are synchronized to music. The nine-minute light show is repeated hourly each night through Christmas Eve. ==Tallest tree== The tallest tree in the country in the 1970s and 1980s was at the National Enquirer offices in Palm Beach, Florida, and reached almost in 1979 when the Guinness Book of World Records listed it as the \"World\\'s Largest Decorated Christmas Tree\". The Enquirer stopped displaying tall trees after owner Generoso Pope died in 1988. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in Manhattan, New York, a Norway spruce, varies yearly from or more. It has likely been the tallest tree in the nation at times since 1988. From 2010 to 2016, the Anthem tree has been and is often listed as the tallest tree in the United States, including in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. In 2015, USA Today ran a Christmas graphic showing the Anthem tree as the nation\\'s tallest at , with the Rockefeller Center tree at . In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the tree was reported as and called Arizona\\'s tallest. ==Statistics== Year Height Width Weight Notes 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 ==Notes== ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Christmas in the United States Category:Individual Christmas trees Category:Tourist attractions in Phoenix, Arizona'\n",

The leaves are heart shaped and the flowers are pale yellow and tubular in form. The plant seeks light by ascending the stems of surrounding plants. ==Toxicity== It was formerly used as a medicinal plant, though it is poisonous, and is now occasionally found established outside of its native range as a relic of cultivation. It is now thought to be the cause of thousands of kidney failures in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. The initial hypothesis that seeds from the plant were unintentionally consumed through contaminated flour has come to be questioned.Batuman, Elif. \"Poisoned Land.\" The New Yorker. August 12 & 19, 2013: 42-47. Print. Urinary tract malignancies among those who have consumed the plant are also reported. The link between kidney failure and aristolochic acid, which the plant contains, was discovered after a clinic for obesity in Belgium used herbal products based on another plant of the same genus as a diuretic.

            " 'A Dark Song is a 2016 Irish-British independent horror film, written and directed by Liam Gavin and starring Steve Oram and Catherine Walker. It was released to select theatres and digital streaming platforms on 28 April 2017. It is Gavin\\'s directorial debut. ==Plot== A bitter and grieving Sophia Howard rents an isolated house in rural Wales to convince short-tempered occultist Joseph Solomon to lead her in a grueling, months-long rite dictated from The Book of Abramelin to summon her guardian angel, whom Sophia can then ask to speak with her dead seven-year-old son. Solomon explains that once they begin, if they leave the house before the ritual is finished, they will be in grave peril, and that Sophia must endure months of punishing exercises in which they will deal with real demons and angels. She agrees. She then complies with dozens of painful, harrowing exercises, but refuses to do the forgiveness ceremony. To compensate for her refusal, Solomon insists she must drink his blood, and also says they must have sex as part of the ritual. After manipulating her into taking off her clothes, he masturbates, then tells her it was just for his own release, not for ritualistic purposes. Sophia gets revenge by urinating in his breakfast the next day. They begrudgingly get to know one another over time. However, after months, a frustrated Sophia complains that it’s taking too long, and Solomon accuses her of impairing the ritual by not being honest about something. She admits that the real favor she will ask the angel is revenge upon whoever kidnapped and killed her son. That night he awakens her and says that because her dishonesty has made her impure, a re-birthing ritual in the tub is required. However, he drowns her, recites a spell, and revives her with CPR. Angered, she pushes him and he accidentally falls on a large kitchen knife, impaling him in the side. As she treats the wound with their meager medical supplies, he explains that this is a sign that the ritual is beginning to work, and that she will have her revenge. He discloses that he will ask the angel to make him invisible for the rest of his life, to be away from people as he “want[s] some quiet before the hell.” As Solomon soldiers on with the wound, Sophia begins seeing and hearing menacing presences in the house, including the voice of her son. When Solomon\\'s wound becomes infected, he begins to fail and eventually dies in his sleep. When Sophia goes back to his books for further instruction, everything has been crossed out, unreadable. She steps beyond the perimeter of the house but her car won\\'t start. After walking down an empty road, she is disturbed to realize that she has arrived back at the mansion. She re-enters to discover various demons appearing. They drag her to the basement, torment her, and cut off a finger as she tells them how sorry she is. They retreat as a brilliant white light fills the house. She finds a massive, beatific angel in armor awaiting her. She asks it for the power to forgive, and it smiles. Later, she performs a water burial of Solomon, then drives away. ==Cast== *Steve Oram – Joseph Solomon *Catherine Walker – Sophia Howard *Mark Huberman – Neil Hughes *Susan Loughnane – Victoria Howard *Nathan Vos - Jack ==Release== A Dark Song premiered 8 July 2016 at the Galway Film Fleadh in Ireland, and was shown at the 2016 Fantastic Fest, the 2016 BFI London Film Festival and the 2016 Boston Underground Film Festival.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds approval rating based on reviews, with a rating average of . Its consensus reads: \"A Dark Song offers atmospheric, unsettling horror — and marks writer-director Liam Gavin as one to watch.\" Tara Brady of The Irish Times called it \"a nifty, novel Irish horror.\" Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is a \"classy effort throughout, from cinematographer Cathal Watters\\' beautiful vistas of the rugged Welsh landscape to Ray Harman\\'s spare, brooding, dread-filled score. Oram\\'s typically sour, surly, slyly comic performance also grounds the plot in a grubby realism that serves its more fantastical elements well.\" Haleigh Foutch of Collider wrote, \"A Dark Song spins many webs of mystery and keeps you puzzling out every mystery up until the audacious ending you definitely won\\'t see coming.\" Scott Weinberg of Nerdist wrote, \"Two complete strangers cutting themselves off from the world inside of a dilapidated mansion? That\\'s already a movie I want to see. But once A Dark Song starts delving into issues like love, loss, faith, and the natural human reaction to sudden tragedy, that\\'s when it blossoms from a novel concept to a truly powerful piece of genre filmmaking.\" == References == == External links == * * Category:Irish independent films Category:Irish supernatural horror films Category:Films set in Wales Category:Films shot in Wales Category:2016 horror films Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:Films about magic Category:Films about angels Category:English- language Irish films Category:2010s English-language films'\n",

            " 'Athletic Football Club Eskilstuna, also known as AFC Eskilstuna or simply AFC, is a Swedish football club located in Eskilstuna. The club has previously been known under the names FC Café Opera and Väsby United before switching ownership and their identity again in 2012 to AFC United. During the 2016 season it was once again decided that they would switch their name, identity, as well as locality. Choosing to move to Eskilstuna, about 110 kilometers west of Stockholm, they are since known as AFC Eskilstuna. They compete in Superettan, the second highest tier of Swedish football, and play their home matches at Tunavallen. AFC Eskilstuna are affiliated to Södermanlands Fotbollförbund. ==Background== ===FC Café Opera=== FC Café Opera was created in 1991 by Italian born restauranteer Alessandro Catenacci who named the club after Café Opera which he owned. They started out in division 8 of the Swedish football league system but only nine years later they had made it to the second tier Superettan. ===Väsby United=== Football Club Väsby United was formed in 2005 when the two Stockholm clubs FC Café Opera United and Väsby IK FK merged. The new club replaced FC Café Opera United in the Superettan making it the youngest club competing at this level. Väsby United was a feeder club to AIK who participated in the second and third divisions of the Swedish football league system. The club played in Division 1 Norra which is the third tier of Swedish football when they became AFC United. ===AFC United=== AFC United was founded when FC Väsby United increased their cooperation Division 3 club Athletic FC in late 2012. They played their home matches at Skytteholms IP in Solna until the end of the 2016 season. Athletic FC was founded in 2007 and defunct in 2012, they then became part of AFC United, the club that later became known as AFC Eskilstuna. In 2012, Athletic FC played in Swedish football Division 3 Norra Svealand which is the fifth tier of Swedish football. They played their home matches at the Skytteholms IP in Solna. The club was affiliated to Stockholms Fotbollförbund. ===AFC Eskilstuna=== During the 2016 season the club management decided to uproot and leave Solna and move to Eskilstuna and Tunavallen before the 2017 season. They also changed their name to AFC Eskilstuna. The team were winless, having only acquired 4 points from the opening 12 matches and were firmly rooted to the bottom of the league table. Michael Jolley was announced as new manager on 13 June 2017. Under Jolley\\'s coaching they took 15 points from the next 16 games. A 3–1 victory over Malmö FF on 19 August 2017 in particular provided the biggest shock of the season in Allsvenskan. However, they were eventually relegated to Superettan on 23 October 2017 following a spirited fight when Jönköpings Södra IF defeated Kalmar FF 2–0, meaning AFC Eskilstuna could no longer reach the qualifying position. Jolley departed ways with AFC Eskilstuna on 9 January 2018 by mutual consent, after being unable to agree on the future direction of the club. On 15 January 2018, Nemanja Miljanović became the manager, after their relegation to the Superettan. ==Season-to-season== Season Level League Pos FC Väsby United FC Väsby United FC Väsby United FC Väsby United 2005 Tier 2 Superettan 9th 2006 Tier 2 Superettan 14th (R) 2007 Tier 3 Division 1 Norra 2nd (P) 2008 Tier 2 Superettan 9th 2009 Tier 2 Superettan 12th 2010 Tier 2 Superettan 16th (R) 2011 Tier 3 Division 1 Norra 2nd 2012 Tier 3 Division 1 Norra 11th AFC United AFC United AFC United AFC United 2013 Tier 3 Division 1 Norra 10th 2014 Tier 3 Division 1 Norra 1st (P) 2015 Tier 2 Superettan 8th 2016 Tier 2 Superettan 2nd (P) AFC Eskilstuna AFC Eskilstuna AFC Eskilstuna AFC Eskilstuna 2017 Tier 1 Allsvenskan 16th (R) 2018 Tier 2 Superettan 3rd (P) 2019 Tier 1 Allsvenskan 16th (R) 2020 Tier 2 Superettan 9th ==Players== ===Current squad=== ==Attendances== Väsby United had the following average attendances: Season Average Attendance Division / Section Level 2005 1,124 Superettan Tier 2 2006 487 Superettan Tier 2 2007 446 Div 1 Norra Tier 3 2008 450 Superettan Tier 2 2009 405 Superettan Tier 2 2010 723 Superettan Tier 2 2011 290 Div 1 Norra Tier 3 2012 206 Div 1 Norra Tier 3 In recent seasons AFC United have had the following average attendances: {| class=\"wikitable\" Season Average Attendance Division / Section Level 2013 179 Div 1 Norra Tier 3 2014 176 Div 1 Norra Tier 3 2015 346 Superettan Tier 2 2016 698 Superettan Tier 2 The highest attendance for FC Väsby United at Råsunda was 8,672 spectators who attended the match with AIK on 15 August 2005. ==Achievements== ===League=== * Superettan: ** Runners-up (1): 2016 * Division 1 Norra: ** Winners (1): 2014 ** Runners-up (2): 2007, 2011 ===Cup=== * Svenska Cupen ** Runners-up (1): 2019 ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ==External links== * *AFC Eskilstuna on WorldFootball Category:Allsvenskan clubs Category:2007 establishments in Sweden Category:Association football clubs established in 2007 Category:Football clubs in Södermanland County'\n",

            " ', nicknamed Zenjo (全女: 全 meaning \"All\", 女 meaning \"Woman\") was a joshi puroresu (women\\'s professional wrestling) promotion established in 1968 by Takashi Matsunaga and his brothers. The group held their first card on June 4 of that year. For many years, it had a TV program on Fuji TV called Women\\'s Professional Wrestling. == History == upright|thumb|Bull Nakano upright|thumb|Aja Kong The All Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling Corporation, established in 1968, was the successor to the All Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling Association, which had been formed in August 1955, to oversee the plethora of women\\'s wrestling promotions that had sprung up in Japan following a tour in November, 1954, by Mildred Burke and her World Women\\'s Wrestling Association (WWWA). These promotions included the All Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling Federation, and the All Japan Women\\'s Wrestling Club, started in 1948, which was the first women\\'s wrestling promotion in Japan. For a time the Club pushed female wrestling as a legitimate sport, booking sporting arenas. By the mid-1960s, the association had fallen apart, due to infighting between the member promotions, and female wrestling was relegated back to being a sideshow act in strip-tease theaters. In 1967, another attempt to organize the sport of women\\'s professional wrestling was made with a new All Japan Women\\'s Pro- Wrestling Association. This time the Fabulous Moolah, the NWA Women\\'s Champion, came across from the United States and traded her title with Yukiko Tomoe, to lend legitimacy to the promotion. The new Association broke up later that year. Finally, Takashi Matsunaga, who had been the promoter for All Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling Federation, formed the All Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling Corporation (AJW) with his brothers. The promotion held its first card on June 4, 1968, and got a television deal with Fuji TV in the same year. In the fall of 1970, AJW, which had been contesting the American Girls\\' Wrestling Association Championship since the previous year, hosted Marie Vagnone, new holder of Mildred Burke\\'s WWWA World Single Championship which had been revived in a WWWA tournament earlier that year in Los Angeles. On October 15, 1970, in Tokyo, Vagnone lost the WWWA title to Aiko Kyo, and AJW had a new world championship singles belt. The next year, AJW acquired the WWWA World Tag Team Championship as well, when Jumbo Miyamoto and Aiko Kyo were made the first champions on June 30, 1971. During the early 1970s, AJW\\'s championship booking was dominated by the traditional trading between a Japanese face and a foreign (usually North American) heel. The tag belt, for example, was traded fifty-six times between 1971 and 1975, each time between a Japanese team and an American team. This pattern began to change in 1975 with the new stardom of Mach Fumiake and the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda). On March 19, 1975, Mach Fumiake won the WWWA Championship from Jumbo Miyamoto, breaking the pattern in the singles division. After that, only three non-Japanese women ever won the belt, the Canadian Monster Ripper, on July 31, 1979, and March 15, 1980, the Mexican La Galactica, on May 7, 1983, and the American Amazing Kong, on June 4, 2004. On July 6, 1980, the promotion had enough popularity to run more shows throughout the country, which resulted in AJW splitting into two teams. Team A featured wrestlers such as Jackie Sato, Jaguar Yokota and Mimi Hagiwara while Team B featured Nancy Kumi, Lucy Kayama and Chino Sato. This lasted until June 1981. During the 1980s, AJW continued to feature extraordinarily talented and popular female wrestlers, including Wrestling Observer Newsletter (WON) Hall of Famers, Bull Nakano, Jaguar Yokota, Devil Masami, Dump Matsumoto, and the Crush Gals (Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka). The feud between the pop culture sensations, the Crush Gals, and the heel stable, Gokuaku Domei, led by Matsumoto, was possibly the most popular angle in all of Japanese wrestling during the 1980s, bringing very high ratings to AJW\\'s weekly television program which caused the show be aired during prime- time. This also resulted in record numbers of girls wanting to become wrestlers with the 1984 auditions having 2,000 candidates. Up until 1986, AJW had been the only major women\\'s wrestling (joshi puroresu or simply joshi) promotion in Japan. Then, on August 17, 1986, Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling (JWP) was started, by former AJW stars Jackie Sato and Nancy Kumi, as well as boxer Rumi Kazama and others. As All Japan Women\\'s popularity cooled off after the Crush Gals retired, the promotion\\'s television show was moved to midnight. While AJW remained the top promotion through the early 1990s, due to talent including Akira Hokuto, Aja Kong, Manami Toyota and Kyoko Inoue, the number of joshi puroresu promotions kept increasing, with Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling and JWP forming in 1992 after the collapse of Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling. This created an unprecedented era of co-operation between the various companies which resulted in many inter-promotional shows including Big Egg Wrestling Universe, the first ever all women\\'s show at the Tokyo Dome. Competition increased again as Gaea Japan formed in 1995 and JDStar formed in 1996 with both promotions having former All Japan Women\\'s stars including Chigusa Nagayo, Akira Hokuto, Lioness Asuka and Jaguar Yokota. 1997 would prove to be a nightmare year for All Japan Women as the owners of All Japan Women\\'s went bankrupt after losing money in real estate, the stock market and other business ventures. Due to this, they lost 14 wrestlers from July to September 1997. Kyoko Inoue, Etsuko Mita, Mima Shimoda, Chaparita Asari, Yoshiko Tamura and others left to form NEO Japan Ladies Pro-Wrestling. Toshiyo Yamada left for Gaea Japan. Aja Kong, Mariko Yoshida, Reggie Bennett, Yumi Fukawa and Rie Tamada left to form Arsion. In October 1997, the promotion\\'s building which held the AJW office, the wrestler dormitories, the training area, the garage (where small events were sometimes held) and a restaurant where the younger wrestlers worked was handed over to creditors. In October, they also lost their television show on Fuji TV which they later regained in July 1998. In 2002, AJW lost its television spot again and the promotion closed it’s doors in April 2005 after 37 years, making it the longest-running promotion in Japan up to that time (Men\\'s promotions New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling have since reached 50 years as of 2022). Promotion company Tajima Kikaku re-established \"New\" AJW in 2006, however they only acquired the rights to the promotion\\'s name and logo from the Matsunaga family, not the titles. The talent was mostly borrowed from JWP Project and the cards were sporadic. In 2012 the \"New\" AJW stopped promoting cards. == Events == The most notable annual events in AJW were the Japan Grand Prix and Tag League the Best. The Japan Grand Prix was held each summer, from 1985 to 2004, and was a tournament to determine the number one contender for the WWWA World Single Championship, similar to the G1 Climax or Champion Carnival seen in the men\\'s promotions New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, respectively. Tag League the Best was held each fall, also from 1985 to 2004, and was a tag team tournament. AJW also held several regular annual events during the 1990s. The first was Wrestlemarinpiad, which was held in the fall or spring from 1989 to 1997, and for the last time in 2000. Also prominent was Wrestling Queendom, held from 1993 to 1997, the first held in November and the rest in the end of March. == Titles == === World Women\\'s Wrestling Association === Championship Final champion(s) Reign Date won Previous champion(s) WWWA World Single Championship Nanae Takahashi 1 March 26, 2006 Kumiko Maekawa WWWA All Pacific Championship Lioness Asuka 1 February 20, 2005 Hikaru WWWA World Tag Team Championship Aja Kong and Amazing Kong 1 October 6, 2004 Vacant WWWA World Martial Arts Championship Fumiko Ishimoto 1 March 21, 1995 Vacant WWWA World Super Lightweight Championship Chaparita Asari 4 May 5, 2003 Ai Fujita WWWA World Midget\\'s Championship Little Frankie 3 August 27, 2002 Vacant WWWA World Midget\\'s Tag Team Championship Pretty Atom and Little Frankie 1 1982 Amakusa Umibozu and Mr. Pone === All Japan Women\\'s Pro-Wrestling commission === Championship Final champion(s) Reign Date won Previous champion(s) AJW Championship Saki Maemura 1 January 3, 2004 Hikaru AJW Junior Championship Rena Takase 1 December 22, 2002 Mika Nishio AJW Tag Team Championship Takako Inoue and Tomoko Watanabe 1 October 6, 2004 Tannie Mouse and Yuki Miyazaki === International Wrestling Association === Championship Final champion(s) Reign Date won Previous champion(s) IWA World Women\\'s Championship Kyoko Inoue 2 January 20, 1997 Takako Inoue === American Girls\\' Wrestling Association === Championship Final champion(s) Reign Date won Previous champion(s) AGWA International Girls\\' Championship Yukiko Tomoe 1 March 31, 1969 Barbara Owens AGWA International Tag Team Championship Aiko Kyo and Jumbo/Yoshiko Miyamoto 5 June 20, 1971 Masked Killer and Masked Lee AGWA United States Girls\\' Championship Miyuki Yanagi 1 1969 Yukiko Tomoe ==Tournaments== Tournament Final champion(s) Year Tag League the Best Hanako Nakamori and Makoto 2016 Japan Grand Prix Kumiko Maekawa 2004 Rookie of the Year Tournament Tomoko Morii 2001 == AJW Hall of Fame == The AJW Hall of Fame had its first inducted class enshrined on November 29, 1998, at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, Japan.

            " 'A [For 100 Cars] is a minimalist composition by Ryoji Ikeda. It was written in 2017 and performed on 15 October as part of a Red Bull Music Academy festival held in Los Angeles. The piece is written for an \"orchestra\" of 100 cars, which produce sound using sine wave synthesisers. Each synthesiser is tuned to a different pitch that has been associated with the note A throughout history. The synthesisers were created by Tatsuya Takahashi and Masimillian Rest. == Composition == Ryoji Ikeda is a Japanese audiovisual artist and composer. He composed A [For 100 Cars] for part of a Red Bull Music Academy (RBMA) festival held in Los Angeles. The idea behind A [For 100 Cars] springs from Ikeda\\'s curiosity with the various frequencies associated to the note A. Throughout history, A been associated with many different frequencies, before being standardised to 440 Hz in 1975 by the International Organization for Standardization. The use of cars in the composition was conceptualised six months prior to its performance, during a conversation between Ikeda and the co-founder of the RBMA, Torsten Schmidt. While talking about cars, they considered making an \"automobile orchestra\". They decided to use synthesisers to create the sounds emitted by the cars. The synthesisers used for the performance at the festival were designed by Tatsuya Takahashi, the synthesiser designer who formerly worked as chief engineer at Korg. The project was the first design Takahashi had made since leaving Korg. Takahashi partnered with Masimillian Rest of E-RM, a Berlin-based musical instrument maker, to create the synthesisers over a period of around three months. Ikeda views the composition as a collaboration between himself and the car drivers. When asked by LA Weekly, he was reluctant to take credit for the piece, saying: == Music == thumb|A [For 100 Cars] is scored for a group of 100 cars. A [For 100 Cars] is performed by a group of 100 cars. This arrangement was called \"the world\\'s largest synth orchestra\" by Mixmag and Vice. A full performance of the piece lasts for around 27–28 minutes. Each car has a synthesiser connected to its sound system which constantly outputs a sine wave drone at a frequency that has been associated with the note A at some point in history, from 1361 to 1936. The frequencies range from 376.3 – 506.9 Hz. Some frequencies chosen by Ikeda include: * 376.3 Hz – A used by the organ of l\\'Hospice Comtesse (dated ) in Lille * 419.6 Hz – A used by the organ of Seville Cathedral * 422.7 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of John Broadwood and Sons, London (17th century) * 427 Hz – A used by the Paris Grand Opera (1811) * 430 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of Henry Lemoine (1810) * 457.2 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of Steinway and Sons (1879) == Performance == thumb|The premiere of A [For 100 Cars] took place opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall.As the piece is loud (reaching almost 160dB), a safety test was completed in Cologne before the performance in Los Angeles. To make sure that it was a safe experience for the driver, Ikeda personally took part in the test. In the performance, all drivers were given a pair of headphones. The performance of A [For 100 Cars] took place on 15 October 2017 at a multi- storey car park at 131 South Olive Street, Los Angeles. This location is opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The 100 cars used for the performance were lined up in rows on top of the car park. The performance began at dusk at 6:17pm in front of an audience of around 1000 people. At the start of the performance, the drivers started their engines and created a grumbling sound by revving them: a sound some likened to an orchestra tuning. The performers were from Los Angeles and were chosen by Ikeda for their car\\'s modified stereos; no performer was a professional musician. The car\\'s designs were varied and included sedans, SUVs and Los Angeles\\' signature lowriders. Each performer was given a score to read which dictated when to play the synthesiser, as well as the volume and octave (from A1 to A8). To better emit the sounds created by Takahashi\\'s synthesisers, some drivers opted to open their car\\'s doors. The performers included some notable residents of the area such as the photographer Estevan Oriol, who was driving his Chevrolet Impala SS. == Reception == A [For 100 Cars] received a mixed reception from reporters and audiences. It was widely seen as unusual: Selim Bulut of Dazed commented that the sound produced was an \"unusual but calming ambient tone\". Writing in Vice, Emily Manning agreed, saying that \"the A notes sounded a bit like what you might expect to hear when UFOs land, but more peaceful, almost like a field of humming June bugs\". In the Los Angeles Times, Randall Roberts wrote that the performance \"felt like a feat not only of bringing imagination to life, but of organization and community\". Jon Caramanica wrote in The New York Times that A [For 100 Cars] \"turned negative space in the center of downtown Los Angeles into a sublime womb [and] felt like a meditation\". Mixmag put the performance on their list of the best performances from the festival, and praised the \"depth of thinking and originality behind the piece [which] made it a breathtaking experience for those in attendance\". Other listeners were not as impressed. In Autoweek, Mark Vaughn wrote that \"most of it sounded, frankly, kind of bland\" but conceded that \"it was kind of cool to experience\". == References == === Sources === * == External links == * YouTube video explaining the project Category:2017 compositions Category:Minimalistic compositions Category:Music of Los Angeles'\n",

            " 'right|thumb|300px|Map of the Aleutian Trench The Aleutian Trench (or Aleutian Trough) is an oceanic trench along a convergent plate boundary which runs along the southern coastline of Alaska and the Aleutian islands. The trench extends for from a triple junction in the west with the Ulakhan Fault and the northern end of the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, to a junction with the northern end of the Queen Charlotte Fault system in the east. It is classified as a \"marginal trench\" in the east as it runs along the margin of the continent. The subduction along the trench gives rise to the Aleutian Arc, a volcanic island arc, where it runs through the open sea west of the Alaska Peninsula. As a convergent plate boundary, the trench forms part of the boundary between two tectonic plates. Here, the Pacific Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate at a dip angle of nearly 45°. The rate of closure is per year. ==Trench morphology== The north side of the trench slopes 3°–4° and the south side 1°–4°.

            " 'The is a flood-control concrete Arch-gravity dam in the town of Ikeda in Fukui Prefecture, Japan owned by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. As the Asuwa River is part of the Kuzuryū River system which flows through the city of Fukui and which was subject to frequent flooding, various flood control projects were planned from the year 1900. A plan to build an auxiliary multipurpose dam on the Asuwa River was finalised in 1967, but no work was actually begun until 1994. Then project immediately encountered strong opposition by the residents of the site to be submerged. Some 220 households were involved, and compensation negotiations were protracted and difficult. Meanwhile, the political momentum of reviewing public works projects has increased nationwide and in 1997 the project was indefinitely frozen. In July 2004, concentrated torrential rains attacked Fukui Prefecture, especially the Asuwa broke its embankments. In Fukui city, 14,172 houses were flooded and five people were killed. The project for a dam on the Asugawa River was revived, despite ongoing opposition from local residents and the Japan Communist Party, both of whom pushed for embankment widening and reinforcement over a dam. Despite the ongoing opposition, construction work began in July 2006. The design was a modified gravity type concrete dam. Initial plans called for a multipurpose dam; however, to placate local residents and in light of reduced demand for water, the design was changed to a specialised flood control dam. Unlike ordinary dams, the Asugawa Dam stores very little water, as the design has large tunnels in its base to permit the river to flow through the dam \"as is\". This so-called \"perforated dam\" stores water only during floods. Therefore, although the Asuwawa reservoir is usually empty, when flooding occurs it stores water and gradually releases downstream. Initially, the dam height was 130.0 m and the total water storage capacity was 72,000,000 tons, but in the final plan, the dam was reduced to 96.0 m and the total water storage capacity to 28,700,000 tons. ==External links== Category:Dams in Fukui Prefecture Category:Ikeda, Fukui'\n",

A member of the Sacramento City Unified School District. == History == During the fall of 2002, developers met with other founding partners to discuss the potential merits of a small healthcare high school for Sacramento. Sacramento was experiencing an extreme shortage of new, qualified healthcare workers and the Sacramento City Unified School District was in the process of developing a network of small, focused high schools. Essentially an incredible design process was initiated. Since that time, the concept has been researched and refined to its present form. Much attention was placed on existing healthcare high school programs that work – in addition to data on students who are successful in collegiate programs. Today, AABHPHS is on the cutting edge of a new generation of small focused high schools – they look forward to sharing the collaborative design process and school model with other communities across the nation. Designed as a small, safe and supportive high school, AABHPHS focuses on assisting students as they develop the educational and social foundation needed to ensure success in college, career, and citizenry. Students study in a safe, structured environment; blending solid academics, applied learning in local health systems and HOSA leadership activities. In 2005, a temporary campus was built for inaugural freshmen for one year. And in late 2006, the final campus was completed. AABHPHS is named after the late Senior Master Sergeant (Retired) Arthur A. Benjamin, U.S.A.F., a life support systems specialist and instructor in the United States Air Force; prior Director for the U.C. Davis Medical Center Cancer Ward; prior Air Force Junior ROTC instructor from nearby Hiram Johnson High School, and prior principal for Hiram Johnson. ==Extracurricular and academic activities== The school offers many extracurricular and academic activities that include: HOSA, MESA, basketball, volleyball, science, Japanese, Latino, yearbook, leadership, anime, martial arts, and dance. The HOSA club and dance club of AABHPHS have gained state recognition.

            " 'Artspace is an online marketplace for contemporary art. The company is based in New York City, New York and was launched in 2011. The site in 2013 had over $100 million in art for sale on its marketplace and had received investment from Accelerator Ventures and Metamorphic Ventures. The company was founded in 2010 by Christopher E. Vroom and Catherine Levene. Levene was named as one of the top 10 female CEOs to watch in 2011 by the Huffington Post. ==History== Christopher E. Vroom and Catherine Levene co-founded Artspace in late 2010. Vroom, an avid art collector and well known patron of the arts, is credited as the strategic vision behind the business, who recognized the potential to create a platform offering quality fine art to a broad audience. Levene stated in a 2011 interview that she felt e-commerce art marketplaces could become the norm for people interested in buying art. She also stated that it could result in a similar market shift for buying art, as that which took place with clothing in the late 1990s. At the time of Artspace\\'s launch, it was stated that the company was one of the first major efforts to commercialize the art marketplace, making art accessible to everyone. Before the launch of Artspace, most art sales were made in person, often in galleries, and transactions were rarely completed online. Another obstacle Artspace had to overcome was that viewing art before purchasing it was a must at the time. Artspace challenged both of these common viewpoints in the art industry. In an interview with Business Insider, Levene said that she felt large auction houses such as Sotheby\\'s had missed an opportunity to open online marketplaces for art. Shortly after the interview in 2011, Levene was named by the Huffington Post as one of the top 10 female CEOs to watch. Vroom was responsible for attracting top-level galleries, museums, cultural institutions and major artists to sell in an online context for the first time. Within the first year of Artspace\\'s existence, it received $1.2 million in investment as an early stage startup. Artspace\\'s products were included in the revolutionary idea STORY, which was developed by Rachel Shechtman later that year. The STORY store in New York City contained art from Artspace, along with products from other startups. The company received two rounds of capital investments, beginning in 2012. A Series A funding round in early 2012 secured $2.5 million for the company, with investors including Accelerator Ventures and Metamorphic Ventures. In early 2013, the company secured a venture capital investment of $8.5 million from Canaan Partners. ==Mechanics== Artspace is an e-commerce platform which performs like an online marketplace. The online service began in 2011 with an inventory of art with a total estimated value of $7–8 million. By 2013, this had increased to more than $100 million in estimated value. The firm is based in New York City and at the time of launch provided contemporary pieces for $200 to $10,000. This value has since changed to include more valuable pieces. Artspace is quoted to have over 2,000 active artists from 400 galleries publishing works through its marketplace. The galleries and cultural institutions cover 30 countries and include The Guggenheim, The Whitney Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and the Serpentine Galleries. Work on the website has come from artists such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Yayoi Kusama. The website and marketplace are aimed at making art more accessible to those who know little about art, or live far away from galleries. In 2013 during an interview, it was stated that the website didn\\'t use any form of advanced imagery to display art, instead using JPEG images. Levene stated, \"Paying that huge sum without seeing the art can be scary for some people, but we\\'ve seen in the last ten years that there is an explosion of sales being made by simply sending JPEGs.\" A 2014 report by Hiscox stated that the online art market was valued at around $1 billion. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:Art galleries established in 2011 Category:Internet properties established in 2011'\n",

            " 'A Maid of Constant Sorrow is the debut album by American singer and songwriter Judy Collins, released in 1961 on Elektra Records and featuring traditional folk songs. ==Content and style== On the album Collins\\' voice and guitar are sparsely accompanied by Fred Hellerman on second guitar and Erik Darling on banjo. The title song is a variant of \"Man of Constant Sorrow\". The selections range from the Scottish anthem \"Wild Mountain Thyme\" to the Irish standards \"Bold Fenian Men\" and \"The Prickilie Bush\". The album also includes more obscure numbers, such as \"Tim Evans\", \"Wars of Germany\" and \"John Riley\". These songs are in the style of social protest, similar to early recordings by Bob Dylan. They reveal a style from Collins different than her later, better- known releases. In \"Tim Evans\", written by Ewan MacColl (Grammy award-winning writer in 1972 of \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\"), she sings of a man wrongfully convicted and hanged for the killing of a woman and child (\"Go down, you murderer, go down\"), whose exoneration comes only after having been hanged. Her alto vocals on lively songs like \"O Daddy Be Gay\" contrast with the social message material. In 2001, Elektra re-released the album on CD with Collins\\' second album, Golden Apples of the Sun (1962). ==Track listing== All songs traditional, arranged by Judy Collins, except where otherwise noted.

The episode was written by Evan Bleiweiss & Michael Narducci and directed by Pascal Verschooris. ==Plot== Elijah (Daniel Gillies) finds evidence that Esther (Alice Evans) was casting a spell during the ball and he believes that Elena (Nina Dobrev) lied to him. He kidnaps Elena who tells him that Esther wants to kill them all. Elijah takes Elena into the tunnels and asks Rebekah (Claire Holt) to watch her and kill her if Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) do not manage to stop Esther in time. Elijah tells Damon and Stefan to stop Esther from completing her plan otherwise Elena will die. In the meantime, Esther asks for Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Abby’s (Persia White) help to complete the spell, Esther needs to channel power from all the dead witches of the Bennett bloodline. Once the spell is cast, the Original vampires will become humans again and Finn (Casper Zafer) is willing to sacrifice himself for his mother\\' cause. When Finn dies, all will die since they are linked as one. Stefan and Damon try to kill Kol (Nathaniel Buzolic), thinking that since the Originals are linked, if they kill him then all the Originals will die. They stab him and everyone collapses except Klaus (Joseph Morgan) who is a hybrid and the dagger does not affect him. Klaus finds Alaric (Matt Davis), Stefan and Damon while they are carrying Kol and removes the dagger. While Rebekah is down, Elena gets an opportunity and runs away getting to the cave where vampires cannot get in and protects herself. Damon and Stefan try to find another way to stop Esther and they decide that they have to break the Bennett bloodline so Esther will not be able to channel their power. They attack Bonnie and Abby and Damon turns Abby into a vampire just in time to stop Esther from completing her spell. Esther and Finn disappear, Rebekah lets Elena go and all the Original siblings, except Rebekah, decide to leave town leaving Klaus behind. Stefan asks Damon why he turned Abby when he was the one supposed to do it and Damon says because he can see that Stefan is trying to get back to his caring self. When Damon asks him how long it has been since he last fed on human blood, Stefan admits that he has not fed on human blood since the day he tried to drive Elena off the bridge. Elijah sends Elena a message apologizing for kidnapping her while Rebekah tells Klaus the old white oak tree has grown back and it can be used by someone to kill them.

Meredith sees him and shoots him telling him that he was not supposed to see that. ==Music== In \"All My Children\" one can hear the songs: *\"Rubicon\" by Ume *\"Guarded\" by Kevin Daniel *\"Teardrops on My Pillow\" by Dum Dum Girls *\"Fire Escape\" by Civil Twilight *\"Poison & Wine\" by The Civil Wars ==Reception== ===Ratings=== In its original American broadcast, \"All My Children\" was watched by 2.90 million; down by 0.18 from the previous episode. ===Reviews=== \"All My Children\" received mixed reviews. Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ rating saying that this episode was \"all about moments, mostly because when you look beyond the moments, everything else kind of falls apart.\" Raisler continues: \"Last week showed the tremendous potential of the Original family, showcasing the family members\\' entertaining dysfunction in all its glory and then immediately giving them a central conflict in their mother’s plan to kill them all. It was intriguing, smart, fun, and very well-executed. All of this great build-up ultimately just made tonight’s easy resolution and scattering of the Originals like leaves to the wind without any sort of resolution that much more disappointing.\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8/10 saying that after last week\\'s revelation of Esther\\'s plan, she is now moving forward very quickly to put it into motion. \"The main problem with Esther moving so quickly on her plan to kill the Originals was that there wasn\\'t enough time for tension in this storyline to build.

With financial backing from others, including John Stanford (father of Charles Villiers Stanford), and with letters of introduction from William Sterndale Bennett, O\\'Leary was able to study at the conservatory in Leipzig, where he arrived in 1847 to study piano (with Ignaz Moscheles), organ, violin, and harmony (with Julius Rietz). During this time he was invited several times to musical dinners where he met, besides Moscheles, Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and Joseph Joachim.Fitzsimons (2008), p. 56; see Bibliography. He also attended Mendelssohn\\'s funeral in 1847. Between February 1852 and December 1854 O\\'Leary studied the piano with Cipriani Potter and Sterndale Bennett at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), London. He became an assistant professor at the RAM in 1856 and elected a fellow in 1864, teaching piano and composition. Among his more notable pupils were Alicia Adelaide Needham, Charles Villiers Stanford, and Arthur Sullivan. He also had other teaching positions in London at institutions including the National Training School for Music (from 1876), the Guildhall School (1880–1900), the Crystal Palace School of Science and Art (from 1886), and the Beckenham School of Music (from 1894). He resigned from the RAM and other positions in 1903. He was elected a member of the Philharmonic Society in 1875. O\\'Leary had married Rosetta Vinning on 5 November 1860 and they had two daughters, Catherine Wyndham and Annette Elizabeth. Annette married Harry Pye, son of Kellow Pye in 1897. Arthur and Rosetta both died in London (Rosetta in 1909), and they are buried in Aghadoe cemetery near Killarney, Ireland. Annette and Harry Pye had one son, Edmund Arthur Pye, born in 1902. He was educated at Epsom College and studied Medicine at Cambridge and St. George\\'s Hospital, London. He married Dorothy Neville in London in 1928, separating after three years, having had one son. Edmund Arthur Pye left his medical career behind after the second world war when, along with his second wife Anne Welsh, he embarked on his better-known career as yachtsman and writer, using the name Peter Pye. His son Patrick Pye was raised in Dublin by his mother and became an artist. ==Selected compositions== Arthur O\\'Leary\\'s largest work is a symphony performed in London in 1853 and 1864. Although he wrote a number of other orchestral pieces, his main work consists of piano music and songs. Raymond Deane commented: \"At the very least, he was a superior drawing-room composer who occasionally touched deeper chords.\"See http://journalofmusic.com/focus/lament-arthur-oleary The following list is based on Fitzsimons (2008), p. 132–6 (see Bibliography below).

            " 'In mathematics, analytic number theory is a branch of number theory that uses methods from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. It is often said to have begun with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet\\'s 1837 introduction of Dirichlet L-functions to give the first proof of Dirichlet\\'s theorem on arithmetic progressions. It is well known for its results on prime numbers (involving the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann zeta function) and additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring\\'s problem). ==Branches of analytic number theory== Analytic number theory can be split up into two major parts, divided more by the type of problems they attempt to solve than fundamental differences in technique. *Multiplicative number theory deals with the distribution of the prime numbers, such as estimating the number of primes in an interval, and includes the prime number theorem and Dirichlet\\'s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. *Additive number theory is concerned with the additive structure of the integers, such as Goldbach\\'s conjecture that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. One of the main results in additive number theory is the solution to Waring\\'s problem. ==History== ===Precursors=== Much of analytic number theory was inspired by the prime number theorem. Let π(x) be the prime-counting function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to x, for any real number x. For example, π(10) = 4 because there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that x / ln(x) is a good approximation to π(x), in the sense that the limit of the quotient of the two functions π(x) and x / ln(x) as x approaches infinity is 1: : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{x/\\\\ln(x)}=1, known as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured in 1797 or 1798 that π(a) is approximated by the function a/(A ln(a) + B), where A and B are unspecified constants. In the second edition of his book on number theory (1808) he then made a more precise conjecture, with A = 1 and B ≈ −1.08366. Carl Friedrich Gauss considered the same question: \"Im Jahr 1792 oder 1793\" (\\'in the year 1792 or 1793\\'), according to his own recollection nearly sixty years later in a letter to Encke (1849), he wrote in his logarithm table (he was then 15 or 16) the short note \"Primzahlen unter a(=\\\\infty) \\\\frac a{\\\\ln a}\" (\\'prime numbers under a(=\\\\infty) \\\\frac a{\\\\ln a}\\'). But Gauss never published this conjecture. In 1838 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet came up with his own approximating function, the logarithmic integral li(x) (under the slightly different form of a series, which he communicated to Gauss). Both Legendre\\'s and Dirichlet\\'s formulas imply the same conjectured asymptotic equivalence of π(x) and x / ln(x) stated above, although it turned out that Dirichlet\\'s approximation is considerably better if one considers the differences instead of quotients. ===Dirichlet=== Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet is credited with the creation of analytic number theory, a field in which he found several deep results and in proving them introduced some fundamental tools, many of which were later named after him. In 1837 he published Dirichlet\\'s theorem on arithmetic progressions, using mathematical analysis concepts to tackle an algebraic problem and thus creating the branch of analytic number theory. In proving the theorem, he introduced the Dirichlet characters and L-functions. In 1841 he generalized his arithmetic progressions theorem from integers to the ring of Gaussian integers \\\\mathbb{Z}[i]. ===Chebyshev=== In two papers from 1848 and 1850, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty L\\'vovich Chebyshev attempted to prove the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. His work is notable for the use of the zeta function ζ(s) (for real values of the argument \"s\", as are works of Leonhard Euler, as early as 1737) predating Riemann\\'s celebrated memoir of 1859, and he succeeded in proving a slightly weaker form of the asymptotic law, namely, that if the limit of π(x)/(x/ln(x)) as x goes to infinity exists at all, then it is necessarily equal to one. He was able to prove unconditionally that this ratio is bounded above and below by two explicitly given constants near to 1 for all x. Although Chebyshev\\'s paper did not prove the Prime Number Theorem, his estimates for π(x) were strong enough for him to prove Bertrand\\'s postulate that there exists a prime number between n and 2n for any integer n ≥ 2\\\\. ===Riemann=== Bernhard Riemann made some famous contributions to modern analytic number theory. In a single short paper (the only one he published on the subject of number theory), he investigated the Riemann zeta function and established its importance for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. He made a series of conjectures about properties of the zeta function, one of which is the well-known Riemann hypothesis. ===Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin=== Extending the ideas of Riemann, two proofs of the prime number theorem were obtained independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin and appeared in the same year (1896). Both proofs used methods from complex analysis, establishing as a main step of the proof that the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is non-zero for all complex values of the variable s that have the form s = 1 + it with t > 0. === Modern times === The biggest technical change after 1950 has been the development of sieve methods, particularly in multiplicative problems. These are combinatorial in nature, and quite varied. The extremal branch of combinatorial theory has in return been greatly influenced by the value placed in analytic number theory on quantitative upper and lower bounds. Another recent development is probabilistic number theory, which uses methods from probability theory to estimate the distribution of number theoretic functions, such as how many prime divisors a number has. Specifically, the breakthroughs by Yitang Zhang, James Maynard, Terence Tao and Ben Green in the field, have all used the Goldston–Pintz–Yıldırım method. Which they originally used to prove that p_{n+1}-p_n \\\\geq o(\\\\log p_n). Developments within analytic number theory are often refinements of earlier techniques, which reduce the error terms and widen their applicability. For example, the circle method of Hardy and Littlewood was conceived as applying to power series near the unit circle in the complex plane; it is now thought of in terms of finite exponential sums (that is, on the unit circle, but with the power series truncated). The needs of Diophantine approximation are for auxiliary functions that are not generating functions—their coefficients are constructed by use of a pigeonhole principle—and involve several complex variables. The fields of Diophantine approximation and transcendence theory have expanded, to the point that the techniques have been applied to the Mordell conjecture. == Problems and results == Theorems and results within analytic number theory tend not to be exact structural results about the integers, for which algebraic and geometrical tools are more appropriate. Instead, they give approximate bounds and estimates for various number theoretical functions, as the following examples illustrate. === Multiplicative number theory === Euclid showed that there are infinitely many prime numbers. An important question is to determine the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers; that is, a rough description of how many primes are smaller than a given number. Gauss, amongst others, after computing a large list of primes, conjectured that the number of primes less than or equal to a large number N is close to the value of the integral : \\\\int^N_2 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log t} \\\\, dt. In 1859 Bernhard Riemann used complex analysis and a special meromorphic function now known as the Riemann zeta function to derive an analytic expression for the number of primes less than or equal to a real number x. Remarkably, the main term in Riemann\\'s formula was exactly the above integral, lending substantial weight to Gauss\\'s conjecture. Riemann found that the error terms in this expression, and hence the manner in which the primes are distributed, are closely related to the complex zeros of the zeta function. Using Riemann\\'s ideas and by getting more information on the zeros of the zeta function, Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin managed to complete the proof of Gauss\\'s conjecture. In particular, they proved that if :\\\\pi(x) = (\\\\text{number of primes }\\\\leq x), then :\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{x/\\\\log x} = 1. This remarkable result is what is now known as the prime number theorem. It is a central result in analytic number theory. Loosely speaking, it states that given a large number N, the number of primes less than or equal to N is about N/log(N). More generally, the same question can be asked about the number of primes in any arithmetic progression a+nq for any integer n. In one of the first applications of analytic techniques to number theory, Dirichlet proved that any arithmetic progression with a and q coprime contains infinitely many primes. The prime number theorem can be generalised to this problem; letting :\\\\pi(x, a, q) = (\\\\text {number of primes } \\\\leq x \\\\text{ such that } p \\\\text{ is in the arithmetic progression } a + nq, n \\\\in \\\\mathbf Z), then if a and q are coprime, :\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x,a,q)\\\\phi(q)}{x/\\\\log x} = 1. There are also many deep and wide-ranging conjectures in number theory whose proofs seem too difficult for current techniques, such as the twin prime conjecture which asks whether there are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is prime. On the assumption of the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture it has been proven recently that there are infinitely many primes p such that p + k is prime for some positive even k at most 12\\\\. Also, it has been proven unconditionally (i.e. not depending on unproven conjectures) that there are infinitely many primes p such that p + k is prime for some positive even k at most 246\\\\. === Additive number theory === One of the most important problems in additive number theory is Waring\\'s problem, which asks whether it is possible, for any k ≥ 2, to write any positive integer as the sum of a bounded number of kth powers, :n=x_1^k+\\\\cdots+x_\\\\ell^k. The case for squares, k = 2, was answered by Lagrange in 1770, who proved that every positive integer is the sum of at most four squares. The general case was proved by Hilbert in 1909, using algebraic techniques which gave no explicit bounds. An important breakthrough was the application of analytic tools to the problem by Hardy and Littlewood. These techniques are known as the circle method, and give explicit upper bounds for the function G(k), the smallest number of kth powers needed, such as Vinogradov\\'s bound :G(k)\\\\leq k(3\\\\log k+11). === Diophantine problems === Diophantine problems are concerned with integer solutions to polynomial equations: one may study the distribution of solutions, that is, counting solutions according to some measure of \"size\" or height. An important example is the Gauss circle problem, which asks for integers points (x y) which satisfy :x^2+y^2\\\\leq r^2. In geometrical terms, given a circle centered about the origin in the plane with radius r, the problem asks how many integer lattice points lie on or inside the circle. It is not hard to prove that the answer is \\\\pi r^2 + E(r), where E(r)/r^2 \\\\to 0 as r \\\\to \\\\infty. Again, the difficult part and a great achievement of analytic number theory is obtaining specific upper bounds on the error term E(r). It was shown by Gauss that E(r) = O(r). In general, an O(r) error term would be possible with the unit circle (or, more properly, the closed unit disk) replaced by the dilates of any bounded planar region with piecewise smooth boundary. Furthermore, replacing the unit circle by the unit square, the error term for the general problem can be as large as a linear function of r. Therefore, getting an error bound of the form O(r^{\\\\delta}) for some \\\\delta < 1 in the case of the circle is a significant improvement. The first to attain this was Sierpiński in 1906, who showed E(r) = O(r^{2/3}). In 1915, Hardy and Landau each showed that one does not have E(r) = O(r^{1/2}). Since then the goal has been to show that for each fixed \\\\epsilon > 0 there exists a real number C(\\\\epsilon) such that E(r) \\\\leq C(\\\\epsilon) r^{1/2 + \\\\epsilon}. In 2000 Huxley showedM.N. Huxley, Integer points, exponential sums and the Riemann zeta function, Number theory for the millennium, II (Urbana, IL, 2000) pp.275–290, A K Peters, Natick, MA, 2002, . that E(r) = O(r^{131/208}), which is the best published result. == Methods of analytic number theory == === Dirichlet series === One of the most useful tools in multiplicative number theory are Dirichlet series, which are functions of a complex variable defined by an infinite series of the form :f(s)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_nn^{-s}. Depending on the choice of coefficients a_n, this series may converge everywhere, nowhere, or on some half plane. In many cases, even where the series does not converge everywhere, the holomorphic function it defines may be analytically continued to a meromorphic function on the entire complex plane. The utility of functions like this in multiplicative problems can be seen in the formal identity :\\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_nn^{-s}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty b_nn^{-s}\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\left(\\\\sum_{k\\\\ell=n}a_kb_\\\\ell\\\\right)n^{-s}; hence the coefficients of the product of two Dirichlet series are the multiplicative convolutions of the original coefficients. Furthermore, techniques such as partial summation and Tauberian theorems can be used to get information about the coefficients from analytic information about the Dirichlet series. Thus a common method for estimating a multiplicative function is to express it as a Dirichlet series (or a product of simpler Dirichlet series using convolution identities), examine this series as a complex function and then convert this analytic information back into information about the original function. === Riemann zeta function === Euler showed that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic implies (at least formally) the Euler product : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {1}{n^s} = \\\\prod_p^\\\\infty \\\\frac {1}{1-p^{-s}}\\\\text{ for }s > 1 where the product is taken over all prime numbers p. Euler\\'s proof of the infinity of prime numbers makes use of the divergence of the term at the left hand side for s = 1 (the so-called harmonic series), a purely analytic result. Euler was also the first to use analytical arguments for the purpose of studying properties of integers, specifically by constructing generating power series. This was the beginning of analytic number theory.Iwaniec & Kowalski: Analytic Number Theory, AMS Colloquium Pub. Vol. 53, 2004 Later, Riemann considered this function for complex values of s and showed that this function can be extended to a meromorphic function on the entire plane with a simple pole at s = 1\\\\. This function is now known as the Riemann Zeta function and is denoted by ζ(s). There is a plethora of literature on this function and the function is a special case of the more general Dirichlet L-functions. Analytic number theorists are often interested in the error of approximations such as the prime number theorem. In this case, the error is smaller than x/log x. Riemann\\'s formula for π(x) shows that the error term in this approximation can be expressed in terms of the zeros of the zeta function. In his 1859 paper, Riemann conjectured that all the \"non- trivial\" zeros of ζ lie on the line \\\\Re(s) = 1/2 but never provided a proof of this statement. This famous and long-standing conjecture is known as the Riemann Hypothesis and has many deep implications in number theory; in fact, many important theorems have been proved under the assumption that the hypothesis is true. For example, under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis, the error term in the prime number theorem is In the early 20th century G. H. Hardy and Littlewood proved many results about the zeta function in an attempt to prove the Riemann Hypothesis. In fact, in 1914, Hardy proved that there were infinitely many zeros of the zeta function on the critical line : \\\\Re(z) = 1/2. This led to several theorems describing the density of the zeros on the critical line. ==See also== * Automorphic L-function * Automorphic form * Langlands program * Maier\\'s matrix method ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * ==Further reading== * Ayoub, Introduction to the Analytic Theory of Numbers * H.

So, it is said that the Ajimas protect Kathmandu Valley. ==Etymology== The word \"Ajima\" comes from two Nepal Bhasa words, \"Aji\" meaning grandmother and \"Ma\" meaning mother. This deity represents all the female ancestors of Newar who have been deified under the influence of the Shaktism branch of Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism. ==History== Newar society was a matriarchial society initially.Page 11, Jigu lumantie yen de mhigah wa thaun by Tirtha Narayan Manandhar, During that era, Ajimas were the most respected deities. Even after the addition of other indigenous deities e.g.-Majipa Lakhey, Lokeshwars (e.g.-Janabahadya), Kumari and other deities of Hindu and Buddhist religions, the deity is still considered of primary importance by Newars. ==Influence== These deities are revered by both Hindus and Buddhists. She is regarded as the protector of children as well. The core city of Kathmandu (which was the city built by planners of Gunakamdev, the founder of Kathmandu), has eight Ajima temples strategically situated at the peripheries of the city. These temples of Ajima used to contain army barracks (the army headquarters is still at the side of Lunmari Ajima aka Bhadrakali). So, these Ajima temples are believed to be protectors of cities as well. The eight Ajimas or Astha Matrika (eight matriarchs) of Kathmandu are as follows\\\\- *Pasikwa Ajima *Lunmari Ajima *Fibwa Ajima *Nai Ajima *Kanga Ajima *Lunti Ajima *Thanbahi Ajima *Chandralakhu Ajima *Phisa Ajima ==See also== *Newar *Nepal Bhasa *Kathmandu *Kathmandu Metropolitan City ==References== Category:Newar'\n",
            " 'Agnipureeswarar Temple (also called Thirupugalur temple) in Thirupugalur, a village in Nagapattinam district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Constructed in the Tamil style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the Cholas period in the 10th century. Shiva is worshipped as Agnipureeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Karundar Kuzhali. The temple is believed to be the place where Saiva saint Appar is believed to have attained salvation. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered Rajagopurams, the gateway tower. The temple is open from 6 am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day Vaikasipournami Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) and float festival for Agnipureeswarar during the Tamil month of Vaikasi being the most prominent festivals. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. ==Legend== The exact history of the temple could not determined based on the inscriptions evidence, but the temple is believed to have been built during the Chola period during the 10th-11th centuries. As per Hindu legend and the Sthalapurana, Shiva was worshipped by Agni, the fire god at this place and the presiding deity came to be known as Agnipureeswarar and the temple tank is called Agni theertham. As per another legend, Bhudevi, the consort of Vishnu wanted to install a Linga and worship Shiva. Banasura, her son, is believed to have dug the Linga at the place, but could not lift it. The lingam in the place is believed to appear tilted (called Konapiran) on account of it. Shiva was pleased with the devotion of Bhudevi and appeared in his dancing form in front of her. It is also believed to be the place where Shiva turned bricks into gold for the Nayanar Sundarar. ==History== The temple has inscriptions dating from Uttama Chola (970–985 CE) from the 10th century. The inscriptions from the time of Rajaraja I (ARE 47 of 1927-28) indicates tax free gifts of land for conducting festivals and for providing offering to the temple every year by Panchanvan Mahadeviyar, one of the consorts of the ruler. Another inscription (ARE 68 of 1927-28) dated to the 27th regnal year of the king indicates gift of paddy and money by Angikumara Gramavittan. The inscriptions (ARE 44 of 1927-28) from the period of Rajendra I (1012–1044 CE) indicates exemption of taxes for certain lands belonging to the temple. The records from Rajadhiraja (ARE 49 of 1927-28) indicates offering by Pichan Sirudaikal of Saliamangalam making a gift of offering to the ashtamangalam ceremony, the eight steps of bathing of the deity (mirror, water-pot, flag, fly-wisk, elephant goad, drum, lamp and a pair of fish). Exclusion of land tax for certain lands of the temple are found from the inscriptions (ARE 79 of 1927-28) from the period of Rajendra Chola II (1054–1063 CE). From the inscriptions it is deducted that the first precinct was probably built during this time. There are also inscriptions from private donors indicating donations of festival images to the temple (ARE 57 & 63 of 1927-28). ==Architecture== The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower facing east and an inner three tier gopuram. The temple is surrounded by a moat like tank and the major portion of the tank is called Agni theertham located in front of the gateway tower. The sanctum is approached through the gateway tower, flagpost, a mahamandapam and an arthamandapam. The Mahamandapam houses the images of Agni, Brahma and saint Appar. The bronze idol of Agni is one of its kind, not present anywhere in the state. The image has two heads and sported with three legs. The sanctum houses the image of Agnipureeswarar in the form of Lingam, a phallic symbol of Shiva. The Linga is tilted indicating a legend that Shiva offered to bend for his devotees. There is another shrine of Shiva called Vardhamaneeswarar, in the name of Tiruppugalur Vardhamaneswaram located adjacent to the sanctum and the image of Muruga Nayanar is located opposite to the sanctum. It is counted as another Paadal Petra Sthalam as it is also glorified in the verses of Tevaram. There is a separate shrine of Karundarkuzhi, the consort of Shiva, sported in standing posture in a South facing shrine. The inner precinct of the temple houses the image of the sixty three nayanmar, Agni, Panchalinga, Appar, Vatapi Ganapathy, Subramanya, Sanisvara, Annapurani, Mahalakshmi and Kalasamhara, while the outer precinct has the images of Chintamanisvara, Vinayaga and the Linga worshipped by sage Bharatvaja. ==Religious importance and festivals== Appar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Agnipureeswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Third Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Sambandar, a contemporary of Sundarar has glorified Agnipureeswarar in ten verses and it is counted as one of the 275 temples. The temple is believed to be the place where Appar spent his last days before proceeding to Kailasam. The event of Appar reaching Kailasam is celebrated in the temple annually. The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed three times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Agnipureeswarar and Gnanambigai. Unlike other shiva temples, anointing with oil is not performed in the temple. There are weekly rituals like (Monday) and (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham, and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) is the most important festivals of the temple. ==Gallery== File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple1.jpg|Rajagopura File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple2.jpg|Tank in front of the temple File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple3.jpg|Rajagopura and Inner gopura File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple4.jpg|Inner gopura File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple5.jpg|Vimana of presiding deity Agnipureeswarar File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple6.jpg|Vimana of Goddess File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple7.jpg|Shrine of Somanayakar File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple9.jpg|Vimanas of Agnipureeswarar and Vardhamaneswarar File:Tirupugaluragnisvarartemple11.jpg|Kosta sculpture ==References== ==External links== Category:Padal Petra Stalam Category:Shiva temples in Nagapattinam district'\n",
            " \"Alexander Jolly (3 April 1756 – 29 June 1838) was bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness in the Scottish Episcopal Church. ==Life== He was born on 3 April 1756, at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, he was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, was ordained deacon in the Scottish episcopal church on 1 July 1776, and admitted priest on 19 March 1777. He was appointed to the congregation at Turriff, Aberdeenshire, taking at the same time occasional duty at Parkdargue (Forgue), and then at Banff and Portsoy. At the desire of Robert Kilgour, Bishop of Aberdeen, Jolly in April 1788 left Turriff for Fraserburgh. 24 June 1796 he was chosen coadjutor to Andrew MacFarlane, bishop of Moray and Ross. After two years of nominal coadjutorship, he was collated (22 February 1798) to the sole episcopal charge of the lowland diocese of Moray, which the bishops had in Jolly's interest disjoined from the highland dioceses of Ross and Argyll, in spite of the opposition of the primus William Skinner. Jolly continued to discharge at the same time the duties of an ordinary pastor in Fraserburgh, where he lived by himself in a plain two-story house in Cross Street. He kept no regular servant, and preferred seclusion. He read daily a fixed number of pages of the Hebrew bible and the Greek New Testament, and portions of the Church Fathers, especially John Chrysostom and Augustine of Hippo. He spent his savings from his income in charity or on books. He declined in 1819 the offer of the see of Ross and Argyll. In 1826 he received the degree of D.D. from Washington College, Connecticut now Trinity College. He died at Fraserburgh on 29 June 1838, and was buried on 5 July beside his brother James in Turriff churchyard. A mural tablet was erected to his memory in the church. His library, which he left to the church, was deposited in the institute in Hill Street, Edinburgh. In his lectures on the church of Scotland, delivered in Edinburgh in 1872, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley selected Jolly ‘as a choice specimen of the old episcopalian clergy.’ ==Works== In 1783 he published at Edinburgh ‘Instructions concerning the Nature and Constitution of the Christian Church, the Divine Appointment of its Governors and Pastors, and the nature and guilt of Schism’ (reprinted at Oxford in 1840 and by the Scottish Tract Society in 1849). During 1826 he published a short treatise entitled ‘A Friendly Address to the Episcopalians of Scotland on Baptismal Regeneration,’ a reply to the attacks made on Scottish episcopal teaching by the Rev. Edward Craig of Edinburgh. Later editions issued in 1840, 1841, and 1850 contain a memoir of the bishop by Patrick Cheyne. Jolly's most popular work was ‘Observations upon the several Sunday Services and principal Holydays prescribed by the Liturgy throughout the Year,’ 1828; 3rd edit., Edinburgh, 1840, with memoir by James Walker, bishop and primus. His last work was ‘The Christian Sacrifice in the Eucharist considered, as it is, the Doctrine of Holy Scripture,’ 1831. ==External links== *Bibliographic directory from Project Canterbury ==References== ;Attribution Category:1756 births Category:1838 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Aberdeen Category:Bishops of Moray, Ross and Caithness Category:People from Stonehaven\"\n",
            " 'is a run-and-gun video game developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in August 1987, in North America in September 1989 after an initial test release of 385 copies in 1987, and an Australian release in 1989. == Story == The people of the planet Farmel, having recently gained the technology for space travel, eagerly explored the galaxy only to find a herd of monstrous \"Air Fortresses\" moving in their direction. They quickly discovered that the Fortresses behaved like interstellar locusts, consuming all of the resources and living things in their path. The Space Federation sent their mightiest fleet, which was quickly eliminated by the powerful Fortresses. In a final gambit they send a single warrior named Hal Bailman, outfitted with a shielded spacesuit, powerful weapons, and small \"lightship\" to infiltrate the Fortresses and destroy them from the inside out. == Gameplay == thumb|left|Inside the Air Fortress As Hal Bailman, the player infiltrates the progressively more challenging Air Fortresses. Each Air Fortress has two levels: the Air Base and the Fortress itself. === Air Base === On approach to the Air Fortress, Hal Bailman battles the enemy from his lightship. The gameplay is that of a side-scrolling shooter. During this phase, the player has three attempts to successfully reach the Air Lock that grants access to the Air Fortress. Along the way, the player must dodge a variety of flying enemies and space station parts. The player also has a chance during this phase to collect energy and \"crash beam bullets,\" a more powerful ammunition that is limited in supply, that can be used inside the Fortress. In this mode of play, a single hit will destroy the player\\'s ship. In the Japanese version, if Hal collides with an enemy while on his lightship he must restart the approach sequence from the beginning; however, in the American version the player will automatically be respawned from the same point at which his ship was destroyed, provided that they have extra lives. === Air Fortress === Inside the Fortress, the game becomes an action-adventure game. The player now has more control over where they go, and finding one\\'s way through the massive Fortresses is one of the major challenges of the game. The player must navigate through the maze, fight off enemy robots, security devices, and spacemen with their beam weapon, locate and destroy the central core of the Fortress, and find their ship to escape. The last is perhaps the most difficult part, since the Fortress explodes shortly after the core is destroyed and the player only has a short window of time in which to escape, with the exit never situated in the same place as where the player entered the maze. == Development and release == Air Fortress was developed by Japanese video game maker HAL Laboratory. \"SUGA,\" the password for the final air fortress, is a reference to Air Fortress director, game designer, and programmer Hiroaki Suga. While the US version credits sound composer Hideki Kanazashi as \"Rodeo Kanagushi\", the Japanese version credits him as \"Jumper Kanagushi\". HAL America offered Air Fortress by mail order through a national advertising campaign. Players who purchased the game through HAL received a free Air Fortress T-shirt. == Reception == Air Fortress garnered average reviews from critics. VideoGames & Computer Entertainments Andy Eddy remarked that the game offered \"a great deal\" of originally with its mixture of arcade and adventure aspects, but found the music to be repetitive and felt that the overall design could have used more color. Nintendo Power gave the game positive ratings to its audiovisual presentation, control, challenge and fun factor. Computer Entertainer commended the visuals but noted that the game\\'s difficulty increased quickly after the first fortress, and found the shooter sequences less interesting than the fortresses. Play Times Oliver Menne highlighted its smooth scrolling and lack of flickering, while praising HAL for their work with the graphics and music. Retrospective reviews for Air Fortess have been more mixed. AllGames Shelby Babb expressed that the game \"does a good job at combining levels of side-scrolling shooting with exploration-style adventure.\" Game Freaks 365s Stan Stepanic praised the music but felt mixed with the visuals, while criticizing its gameplay and difficulty level. Hardcore Gaming 101s Adam King felt overall mixed about the audiovisual presentation but commended the controls. A writer for Jeuxvideo.com gave the title a positive outlook. == References == Category:1987 video games Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Horizontally scrolling shooters Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Run and gun games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in outer space'\n",

            " 'Aššūr-bēl-kala, inscribed maš-šur-EN-ka-la and meaning “Aššur is lord of all,” was the king of Assyria 1074/3–1056 BC, the 89th to appear on the Assyrian Kinglist. He was the son of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra I, succeeded his brother Ašarēd-apil-Ekur who had briefly preceded him, and he ruled for 18 yearsAssyrian Kinglist, iii 29-30, 31, 35. He was the last king of the Middle Assyrian Empire, and his later reign was preoccupied with a revolution against his rule led by one Tukulti-Mer, which, by the end of his reign, allowed hordes of Arameans to press in on Assyria\\'s western borders. He is perhaps best known for his zoological collection. ==Biography== His reign marks the point at which the tide turned against the middle Assyrian empire, and substantial Levantine territory to the west was captured by the invading Arameans. Aššūr-bēl-kala was the last of the monarchs of the second millennium for whom there are any significant surviving inscriptions. His annals are recorded on numerous fragments from Aššur and Nineveh. ===The Broken Obelisk=== The Broken Obelisk,Broken Obelisk, . an unfinished part of a monumental inscription in the British Museum, is usually attributed to him following the arguments made by Weidner, Jaritz and Borger, despite its apparent imitation of the campaigns of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra I and his hunting of a nāḫiru (a “sea-horse”) in the Mediterranean (the “upper sea of the land of Amurru”). These arguments include the introduction of Babylonian month names, its discovery with a limestone statue of a naked Ištar inscribed with his name, the designation of the Arameans as living in KUR a-re-me, and their evident progress into traditionally Assyrian ruled lands. It was discovered by the ethnic Assyrian archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam in mid-August 1853 at a \"locality about half-way between Sennacherib\\'s palace and that of Assurbanipal\" and depicts the (enlarged) king towering over bound, supplicant prisoners under five symbols of the gods. Any reconstruction of the events of his reign consequently depends heavily on whether this object is correctly assigned. In his first year, he campaigned in the north against Urarṭu, delaying his adoption of the eponym office until the following year. In his second, he turned his attention to the countries Himme, Ḫabḫu, and Mari, the latter of which was under the authority of Tukulti-Mer, a pretender to the Assyrian throne. Thereafter his attention was largely absorbed with endless counterattacks against the hordes of Arameans pressing on his borders, whom he even pursued: “[...in] rafts (of inflated) goatskins I crossed the Euphrates.”Annals, VAT 9539, . He fought them as far as Carchemish, which he plundered, and in the Ḫārbūr valley, the Broken Obelisk referencing at least 15 campaigns. Texts recovered from Giricano, ancient Dunnu-ša-Uzibi, mostly dated to the eponym year of Ili-iddina (1069/68) his 5th or 6th year, include one that recalls the fighting the preceding year, the eponymy of Aššur-rem- nišešu, in Dunnu-ša-Liṣur-ṣala-Aššur in the district of Šinamu, when territory was lost. Sometime later the entire region fell to the invaders. ===Building works and zoo=== thumb|The only known Assyrian statue of a naked woman, erected at the temple of Ishtar in Nineveh, during the reign of Ashur-bel- kala, 1073–1056 BC. Currently housed in the British Museum, London Among his civic construction activities were the re-excavation of a city moat and the irrigation of a public garden: The continued prestige of Assyria was acknowledged by the gift of exotic animals by the Egyptians which nišē mātīšu ušebri, “he displayed (the animals) to the people of his land.” These he added to his collection of rare animals which he bred and dispatched merchants to acquire more, such as “a large female ape and a crocodile (and) a ‘river man’, beasts of the Great Sea” and the dromedaries he displayed in herds. Aššūr-bēl- kala’s interests were not solely zoological as he enjoyed hunting and boasts killing wild bulls and cows “at the city of Araziqu which is before the land of Ḫatti and at the foot of Mount Lebanon.” He “rebuilt from top to bottom the storehouses of my lordly palace, which are at the fore part of the enclosure,” and Aššur-nādin-aḫḫē\\'s terrace of the New Palace at Nineveh, placed gate guardians inspired by the nāḫiru he had supposedly hunted. He also repaired a quay wall originally built by Adad-nārārī I (c. 1307–1275 BC). ===Relations with Babylonia=== After his inauguration, he was apparently visited by the reigning Babylonian king, Marduk-šāpik-zēri, who “established friendly relations with Aššūr-bēl-kala,” and then returned to Sippar.Eclectic Chronicle (ABC 24), tablet , obv. 4–7. This treaty followed the earlier poor relations of their predecessors, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra and Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, who had sparred and was probably motivated by their need to unite to fight their common enemy the Arameans. Marduk-šāpik-zēri died around five years later and this seems to have galvanized Aššūr-bēl-kala into intervening militarily to install a successor of his choice: The Synchronistic HistorySynchronistic History (ABC 21), ii 25-37. relates that the next king, Adad-apla-iddina, “son of Esagil-šaduni, son of a nobody,” was appointed by Aššūr-bēl-kala, who married his daughter and “took her with a vast dowry to Assyria,” while the Eclectic Chronicle gives his father as Itti-Marduk-balāṭu. The Synchronistic History concludes with noting that “the people of Assyria and Babylonia mingled (peacefully) with one another.” His tomb was one of the five found on the lower reaches of the palace at Assur. He was briefly succeeded by his son, Erība-Adad II, whose short reign was followed by that of his brother Šamši- Adad IV. ==Inscriptions== ==References== Category:11th-century BC Assyrian kings'\n",

A spin-off of the series entitled A Double Shot at Love featuring the bisexual \"ikki twins\" premiered on December 9, 2008.

            " \"At the 2005 Jeux de la Francophonie, the athletics events were held at the Stade Général Seyni Kountché in Niamey, Niger, from 11–16 December 2005. A total of 43 events were contested, of which 23 by male and 20 by female athletes. France sent the largest squad and topped the medal table with 19 gold medals and 39 medals in total. Morocco was the next most successful nation, having won 11 golds and 31 medals altogether. This was large as a result of their middle- and long-distance running dominance which saw them take all three medals in four events, as well as three separate Moroccan 1–2 finishes. Canada and the Ivory Coast were third and fourth in the medal tally. Twenty of the 37 nations competing won a medal, although hosts Niger went empty-handed in the athletics competition. The performances were down in comparison to the 2001 edition in Ottawa, which had benefited from being held a few weeks before the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, also in Canada that year. Two Games records were broken over the course of the competition, but a number of African athletes broke their national record – home athletes improved six different Nigerien records.Fuchs, Carole (2005-12-17). Francophone Games – Final Day. IAAF. Retrieved on 2010-08-01. Among the prominent medallists were Moroccans Yassine Bensghir and Seltana Aït Hammou, who completed 800/1500 metres doubles on the men's and women's sides respectively. Their compatriot Zhor El Kamch won both the women's 5000 metres and 10,000 metres while Tarik Bougtaïb took a gold and a silver in the horizontal jumps. Yves Niaré of France was dominant in the throws, winning the shot put and discus throw events. Chad's efforts were led by Kaltouma Nadjina who won two golds for her 200 metres and 400 metres performances – her nation's only medals of the entire multi-sport event that year. ==Records== Name Event Country Record Type Rachid Kisri Men's marathon 2:17:03 GR Zhor El Kamch Women's 10,000 metres 33:41.28 GR Key:WR — World record AR — Area record GR — Games record NR — National record Key:WR — World record AR — Area record GR — Games record NR — National record Key:WR — World record AR — Area record GR — Games record NR — National record Key:WR — World record AR — Area record GR — Games record NR — National record Key:WR — World record AR — Area record GR — Games record NR — National record ==Medal summary== ===Men=== 100 metres 10.48 10.52 10.55 200 metres 20.99 21.01 21.12 400 metres 46.43 46.52 47.13 800 metres 1:47.11 1:49.10 1:49.52 1500 metres 3:46.58 3:46.84 3:47.84 5000 metres 14:16.23 14:16.39 14:16.41 10,000 metres 29:17.11 29:18.05 29:18.06 110 metres hurdles 13.68 13.70 14.08 400 metres hurdles 50.67 50.71 51.04 3000 metres steeplechase 8:52.73 9:01.03 9:08.33 4×100 metres relay Jean-Ukruch Kouassi Tiecura Marius Loua Ben Youssef Meité Éric Pacôme N'Dri 39.79 Yannick Urbino Thierry Lubin Christophe Cheval Jérôme Éyana 40.09 Arnaud Casquette Fernando Augustin Henrico Louis Ommana Kowlessur 40.28 4×400 metres relay Younes Frhani Abdelkrim Khoudri Younés Belkaifa Ismael Daif 3:06.87 Jean-Francois Degrasse Ommana Kowlessur Anton Vieillesse Fernando Augustin 3:07.46 El Hadji Sethe Mbow Jacques Sambou Ibou Faye Cheikh Drame 3:11.37 Marathon 2:17:03 GR 2:17:18 2:18:46 20 km walk 1:30:47 1:31:16 1:32:36 High jump 2.24 m 2.20 m Not awarded Not awarded Pole vault 5.40 m 5.30 m 5.20 m Long jump 7.98 m 7.78 m (w)† 7.76 m (w) (wind: 2.4 m/s) Triple jump 16.91 m 16.44 m 16.11 m Shot put 18.64 m 17.19 m 15.49 m Discus throw 54.15 m 54.05 m 52.80 m Hammer throw 71.90 m 71.41 m 67.43 m Javelin throw 71.64 m 67.79 m 65.54 m Decathlon 8046 pts 7307 pts 7097 pts *† = Wind speed was not recorded for this jump ===Women=== 100 metres 11.40 11.67 11.72 200 metres 22.92 23.72 23.75 400 metres 52.12 52.57 53.57 800 metres 2:04.63 2:05.30 2:06.49 1500 metres 4:34.32 4:34.46 4:35.60 5000 metres 16:19.71 16:21.54 16:38.02 10,000 metres 33:41.28 GR 34:41.23 34:59.34 100 metres hurdles 13.47 13.58 13.65 400 metres hurdles 58.27 58.40 59.45 4×100 metres relay Véronique Mang Fabienn Beret-Martinel Aurélie Kamga Carima Louami 44.61 Estelle Brou Makari Sanganoko Louise Ayétotché Amandine Allou Affoue 45.36 Mariette Mien Sarah Tondé Kadidiatou Traoré Béatrice Kamboulé 45.99 NR 4×400 metres relay Phara Anacharsis Aurelie Kamga Aurore Kassambara Sylvanie Morandais 3:37.91 Lauren Seibel Tasha Monroe Melina Thibodeau Esther Akinsulie 3:40.96 Saïda El Mehdi Halima Hachlaf Seltana Aït Hammou Hanane Skhyi 3:42.48 Marathon 2:45:28 Not awarded Not awarded 2:50:13 High jump 1.83 m 1.83 m 1.79 m Pole vault 4.15 m 4.05 m 3.95 m Long jump 6.42 m 6.24 m 6.22 m Triple jump 13.23 m 13.18 m 13.05 m Shot put 16.32 m 15.93 m 14.81 m Discus throw 52.28 m 49.52 m 48.72 m Hammer throw 65.12 m 64.02 m 61.96 m Javelin throw 53.92 m 52.71 m 51.34 m ==Medal table== *Note: Arnaud Casquette of Mauritius won long jump and relay bronze medals, but then tested positive for cannabis and was given a six-month ban.

            " \"Andrew Colin Cottam (born 14 July 1973 in Northampton, England) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler. He played in 2 Under-19 Tests in 1992 and 13 first-class matches between 1992 and 1996. His father is the cricketer and coach Bob Cottam. In 1990 Andy Cottam started playing for Somerset Second XI and Devon. In 1992 he was selected for Under-19's tour of Pakistan and played in the Third Test and 2 one-day matches against Pakistan Under-19s. That summer he played in 6 County Championship matches for Somerset and in an Under-19 Test against Sri Lanka, when he took 4 wickets for 69 in the first innings.England Under-19s v Sri Lanka Under-19s scorecard, Cricket Archive However, in 1993 he failed to make the Somerset First XI, apart from a one-day match against Kent. In 1994 he moved to Northants but did not play for the first team and he signed for Derbyshire in 1995. He played in 4 County Championship matches and in a university game and was released at the end of the season. He returned to Somerset, where his father was director of cricket, and played in 2 County Championship matches in 1996. He played for Somerset Second XI in 1997 and for Devon until 1999. Although an economy as a bowler of under three per over in first-class cricket was acceptable, Cottam's bowling did not look like it would do more than take the occasional wicket and he was always a tail-end batsman, so his first-class career was inevitably a short one.Brief profile, Cricket Archive ==References== ==External links== *Andy Cottam at Cricket Archive Category:1973 births Category:English cricketers Category:Living people Category:Cricketers from Northampton Category:Somerset cricketers Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:Devon cricketers\"\n",

            " 'thumb|right|Official logo Arturo Fuente is a cigar brand founded by Arturo Fuente, Sr. in 1912 in West Tampa, Florida. Following a catastrophic fire in 1924, the brand ceased production for 22 years, reemerging in 1946 on a limited, local basis. Ownership was transferred to Arturo\\'s younger son, Carlos Fuente, Sr. in 1958. Following the 1960 United States embargo of Cuba, the Fuente brand began a period of slow and steady growth, emerging as one of the most critically acclaimed makers of hand-rolled premium cigars outside of Cuba. As of 2010, the company was producing 30 million cigars per annum from its factory in the Dominican Republic. == History == ===Establishment=== The Arturo Fuente cigar brand was born in 1912 in West Tampa, Florida.David Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 20, no. 2 (Jan.-Feb, 2012), pg. 90. The brand was launched by a 24-year-old Cuban émigré named Arturo Fuente (November 18, 1887 – February 11, 1973) as A. Fuente & Co.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pg. 92. Fuente had come to the United States in 1902, leaving his hometown of Güines, Cuba in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War. The original factory used by the company was a three- story wooden building, one of nearly 200 cigar-making facilities in the city of Tampa alone. All of these manufacturers would import tobacco from nearby Cuba for production into finished cigars. The company was incorporated in 1924, by which time A. Fuente & Co. had grown to the point that it employed 500 workers. However late in 1924 disaster struck the company and their building burned to the ground. Production of the brand was halted; it would not be until 1946, 22 years later, that production of the brand resumed. ===1946 reestablishment=== By the end of World War II Arturo Fuente had finally recovered from the catastrophic losses suffered in 1924 fire and the Great Depression had abated, making a return to cigar manufacturing again conceivable. Fuente relaunched his brand \"in the garage,\" so to speak—adding a few rolling tables to the 160 square foot back porch of his home in Ybor City, Florida. Production was a family affair at the time of the 1946 restart, with Arturo and his wife rolling full-time, joined by a few other hired torcedores. Arturo\\'s sons—Carlos and Arturo, Jr.—were soon drafted into the enterprise, sweeping the floors and helping with the rolling after school. Carlos Fuente, Sr., the son of Arturo, contracted polio as a boy of 12 but was fortunate in recovering well enough to walk normally, unlike many victims of the disease.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pg. 93. He dropped out of school before graduating high school and was married at age 18.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pp. 93, 95. Because the cigar business struggled during the 1940s and 1950s, Carlos, Sr. took a job as a baker to help make ends meet, while his wife worked full-time in another factory while both moonlighted at Fuente.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pp. 95. Throughout the 1950s Fuente remained exclusively a local Tampa brand, with the company\\'s entire production sold in that city on a cash-and-carry basis. ===Transfer of ownership=== Arturo Fuente, Sr. had originally envisioned passing the small family cigar business on to his eldest son, Arturo, Junior, but it was his younger son Carlos that spent the most time working in the firm, so it was to him that it was offered in 1958.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pp. 97. Carlos Fuente, Sr. bought the business from his father for exactly $1—purchasing $1,161 in assets and zero debt. At the time the company made only a few thousand cigars a year. Carlos, Sr. was ambitious and sought to expand the business, first seeking to establish new accounts in other parts of Florida before setting his sights on New York City. Fuente initially targeted a Hispanic market for its product. Growth was slow since cigar smokers of the era were brand loyal and not prone to the sampling of new products. The United States embargo against Cuba would change all that. ===After the embargo=== thumb|Arturo Fuente cigar boxes at 2005 Tampa Cigar Heritage Festival. The Montesino cigars are also produced by Tabacalera A. Fuente y Cia. Up until the 1962 embargo, cigars were typically made in the United States of Cuban tobacco. Following the embargo, access to Cuban tobacco was abruptly terminated, forcing every cigar maker to change the blends that they used. Carlos Fuente, Sr. later recalled: > \"In the old days, people were very brand true. Brand loyal. ... I feel the > embargo put everybody level. People had to shop around to find a different > taste that they liked.\" Fuente shopped for new sources of tobacco, buying leaf from new regions like Puerto Rico and Colombia. Blending skills were then employed in an effort to create a flavor appealing to smokers who had developed an affection for classic Havano flavors. Rising labor costs made continued American production uneconomical. In addition, the company had increasing difficulty in finding qualified cigar rollers in Florida. Efforts were made to establish the brand\\'s production in Mexico and Puerto Rico, but quality from these factories was deemed insufficient. In the 1970s contacts were made between Carlos Fuente, Sr. and a representative of the blossoming Nicaraguan cigar industry and the company soon moved its production to Estelí in the Northwestern part of that Central American country. However, disaster again struck in 1979 when the Fuente factory was burned to the ground during the Nicaraguan Revolution. With Nicaragua a total loss, Carlos Fuente, Sr. mortgaged his house to raise capital and his son Carlos, Jr. added whatever money he had available and the family moved to the Dominican Republic to begin anew.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pp. 97, 100. Carlos Fuente, Sr. later recalled the decision to build inventory as decisive: > \"When I first started in the Dominican, all our profit, we stuck it back. > All our profit was always invested in tobacco. And aged tobacco is the most > important thing that you can have. We always had a lot of aged tobacco. And > as we started aging more and more, we started doing better.\"Quoted in > Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pg. 100. In September 1980 Tabacalera A. Fuente opened a 12,000 square foot factory in Santiago Dominican Republic.Perelman, Perelman\\'s Cigar Cyclopediia, pg. 63. The company scored its first success of its \"Dominican Period\" in the middle 1980s with the launch of the medium-bodied Hemingways line — an attempt to break new ground in the market through the use of special shapes.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pg. 100. At the end of the 1980s the company began to grow its own tobacco on a substantial scale for the first time, investing in roads and curing barns.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pg. 101. The company even took on the challenge of growing its own wrapper leaf—the most difficult and risky component of a cigar to produce. ===Company today=== As of 2010, Carlos Fuente, Sr. and his son Carlos Fuente, Jr. oversaw an operation that produced more than 30 million cigars per year. Carlos Fuente, Sr. died August 5, 2016, in Tampa. He was 81. ==Specific products== The Arturo Fuente line of cigars ranges from the inexpensive to the premium. The full-bodied Fuente Fuente Opus X, introduced to the market in November 1995, is regarded the brand\\'s flagship product. The cigar is a Dominican puro (i.e. 100% grown in that one country) making use of Rosado wrapper grown by Fuente\\'s own farm.Richard B. Perelman, Perelman\\'s Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars: 2011 Edition. Los Angeles, CA: Perelman Pioneer and Co., 2010; pg. 294. The cigar is made in 13 vitolas ranging in size from the 4-5/8 inch by 49 ring gauge \"Belicoso XXX\" to the massive -inch by 47 \"Perfecxion A.\" The cigar achieved great critical success, with the corona size named as Cigar Aficionado magazine\\'s 2005 Cigar of the Year and the Belicoso XXX rated by that publication as the world\\'s number 3 release in 2010. In 2004 Cuban-American actor and director Andy García contacted Carlos Fuente, Jr. seeking to film scenes for the film The Lost City in the Fuente tobacco fields.Perelman, Perelman\\'s Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars: 2011 Edition, pg. 293. The film was scheduled to shoot in July of that year, however—a time after the crop had already been harvested. To provide a setting for the film 15 acres were planted by Fuente in tobacco during what would ordinarily have been the off season. The resulting special crop—harvested, cured, and manufactured for first release in 2009 — was very successfully marketed as the Opus X Lost City Edition. Five vitolas of this special edition were produced in 2010, with very limited productions ranging from 4,000 to 12,000 cigars per size. Fuente is also known for quality control. The Fuente family packs their cigar boxes with an advanced 2-way humidification device (Boveda) that helps to ensure the stability and freshness of the end product. ==Other manufacturing== Arturo Fuente is the manufacturer of the Ashton brand, established in 1985 by Robert Levin of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Perelman, Perelman\\'s Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars: 2011 Edition, pg. 66. The company also makes some of the cigars sold by the J.C. Newman Cigar Company of Tampa, Florida.Savona, \"100 Years of Fuente,\" pg. 102. J.C. Newman returns the favor, handling the production of all of Arturo Fuente\\'s machine-made product.

Otep has cited The Doors as an inspiration for the band. \"That song for me fits the record 100%. The producer and I, Ulrich Wild, he helped transform that song from a 60’s hippy transcendental song into an edgy, transcendental modern hard rock song. If the Doors were a current band, what would that song sound like now? That’s the approach we tried to take. Preserve the spirit of what they were creating but take it into a new place as well.” == Release and promotion == On March 8, Otep Shamaya shared the track titles \"Atom to Adam\", \"Blood of Saints\", \"Remember to Forget\", and \"We Dream Like Lions\" via Facebook and Twitter.

            " \"thumb|elder Egyptian statesman Ali Shamsi Pasha (also spelled Shamsy, Shemsi, or Chamsi) was an Egyptian statesman. ==Life== He was born in Egypt in 1885 the scion of senior members of the Tufenkjians, an Ottoman mounted military corps dating back to the 17th century when Egypt was ruled by walis or governors appointed by the sultan in Istanbul. ===Family=== Among Ali's ancestors we find the five Tufenkjian brothers who were exiled to the Hedjaz in 1768 for their attempt at toppling the incumbent governor. Wrapping up four generations of righteous Tufenkjian officers, Ali Shamsi's ancestor, Serwan- Pasha Mohammed Tufkenjian-Shamsi, was aide-de-camp to Mohammed Ali Pasha. Having recently restored the Timraz al-Ahmadi Mosque in Cairo's Darb al-Shamsi (Sayeda Zeinab district), Mohammed was buried therein circa 1817. The mosque had already been renovated the previous century by Mohammed's uncle al-Sharif Hassan Tufenkjian-Shamsi, a devout member of the Sufi al-Qadiriyah Order founded by his maternal ancestor Abdel Qader al-Jilani. In addition to being a leading industrialist and head of the Ashraaf syndicate in his Delta province, Ali Shamsi's father, Amin Shamsi Pasha, was also Sharkia's ser-tujar, or merchant provost, as well as its recurring representative to the Egyptian legislature up to 1913 despite his much publicized imprisonment for his decisive support of the failed 1882 Orabi Revolt. ===Role in Politics=== As Amin pasha exits the scene, Ali Shamsi Pasha takes over his father's seat at the legislature in 1914. His mission was to define the concept of a distinct Egyptian people blended out of an ethnic mix of Copts, Fellahs, Bedouins, Circassians, Turks, Balkans, Levantine, Kurds and Nubians. ===Exile=== He was subsequently exiled to Europe for his political convictions he returns triumphantly several years later to cofound with Saad Zaghloul Pasha the nationalist Wafd Party. Ali Shamsi MP became in turn minister of finance and later education and was a sometime candidate to the post of prime minister. He was also Egypt's first representative to the League of Nations. He would later head the National Bank of Egypt (functioned as a Central bank at the time) which heretofore was traditionally chaired by a Briton. Having spent most of his student and exile years in Switzerland, Ali Shamsi Pasha wed Helene Emile Burnet at Geneva's Eaux Vives neighborhood on 15 August 1928. Absenting himself from the political scene, he joined the board of several leading companies, including the Paris-based Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez up until its nationalization in 1956. ==Death== Ali Shamsi died in February 1962. ==Political relations== To be noted three of Ali Shamsi's nephews spent time in jail for their political beliefs. Hussein-Zulfiqar Sabry, a disillusioned welterweight prizefighter and brash World War II military-plane hijacker, strived for Sudan's independence prior to becoming the nation's de facto foreign policy chief. Wing Commander Ali Sabri poised at the epicenter of power, first as prime minister and later as party boss only to be outfoxed by his nemesis Anwar al-Sadat. Wahid Raafat, a civil rights advocate calling for a constitutional democracy and the return of the military to their barracks. Later, he would confound the neo-Wafd and play a crucial role in the landmark Taba arbitration. ==See also== *Tufenkjians ==References== * Privileged for Three Centuries: The House of Chamsi Pasha, Elias Press Cairo, 2011 * Family, Power and Politics in Egypt, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1982 * Merveilles Biographiques et Historiques ou Chroniques, al-Djabarti, Abdel Rahman, Imprimerie Nationale, Le Caire, 1889 * Egypt for the Egyptians, Ithaca Press, London, 1981 * Ali Shamsi and league of nations * Ali Sabri Egyptian prime minister * Hassanein Heikal on Ali Shamsy Pasha Category:1885 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Egyptian pashas Category:20th-century Egyptian businesspeople\"\n",

Reyes stepped down as defense secretary on August 29, 2003, but was later named Anti-Kidnapping Presidential Adviser on October 26, 2003, after President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order Number 248 creating the Office of the Anti-Kidnapping Presidential Adviser, and subsequently, the National Anti-Kidnapping Task Force (NAKTF) to address the problem of kidnapping in the country. His installation as anti-kidnapping czar resulted in the neutralization of certain kidnap-for-ransom gangs. Reyes was later appointed as the Presidential Adviser on Anti-Smuggling on March 10, 2004, by virtue of Executive Order Number 297 to orchestrate and oversee a consolidated national anti-smuggling campaign. Throughout his career, Secretary Reyes received various awards and decorations from both the military and civilian institutions. He was a recipient of the Philippine Legion of Honor, AFP Distinguished Service Star, Military Merit Medals, Anti-Dissidence Campaign Ribbons and other Philippine military decorations. He was awarded the Order of the White Elephant by King Bhumibol of Thailand and the Order of Valor by the King of Malaysia. As a civic leader, he was chosen as the Most Outstanding Project Chairman by the Philippine Jaycees for Project “The Youth Speaks” in 1981. That same project was later adjudged as the Most Outstanding External Affairs Project in the World during the Jaycees World Convention in Germany in 1991. In 1991, he was given the honor of being a Kabisig Awardee for his Project: Common Cause, Uncommon Zeal\". (KABISIG is a nationwide government socio-economic project in rural areas). With all these accomplishments, he was named the Most Outstanding Alumnus of the Asian Institute of Management in 1982 and Most Outstanding PMA Alumnus (Cavalier Award for Public Administration) in 2001. ===Secretary of the Interior and Local Government=== Reyes was Secretary of the Interior and Local Government in the administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from 2004 to 2006. ===Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources=== Reyes was Philippine Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources in the administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from 2006 to 2007. ===Secretary of Energy=== thumb|Rear Adm.

On January 29, 2008, Energy Secretary Angelo Reyes announced that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 8-man team led by Akira Omoto inspected the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant on rehabilitation prospects. The team members were Zhang Jing, IAEA section head for Asia and the Pacific; Ki Sig Tang, technical officer at the nuclear division; David Greaves and Eric Weinstein; 3 independent experts: John Rames, an expert on legal infrastructure from Australia; Jose E. Brayner, Costa Mattos, a nuclear power expert from Brazil; and Ioan Rotaru, a nuclear power expert from Romania.\"AFP: IAEA team assessing Philippines nuclear prospects: report .

As the Energy Chief, Reyes promoted, spearheaded numerous successful projects that defined, created and stabilized the country\\'s energy supply and security. At the time when the global crude oil spiked to its record highs, Reyes did an excellent job as the energy chief by implementing various programs to assist consumers adjust to the new cost of gas and other fuels at the pump. He also re-launched the Compressed Natural Gas Program and issued the only Government Accreditation to Callandra LCNG Fuels Corporation. ==Corruption allegations and death== On January 27, 2011, retired Lt. Col. George Rabusa, who served as AFP\\'s budget officer during Reyes\\' tenure as Armed Forces chief, testified before a Senate panel and accused Reyes of receiving P50 million in \"send-off\" money when he retired from the Armed Forces, as part of a decades-old military tradition. Reyes denied receiving such funds for his own use and sought to cross-examine Rabusa, but was refused the opportunity.Reyes allegedly given P50m as ‘send-off’ gift - 2011/january/28. Manila Standard Today. Retrieved on 2011-02-08. Reyes then did not attend subsequent hearings in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. On the morning of February 8, 2011, a month before his 66th birthday, Reyes, together with two of his sons and a bodyguard, visited his parents\\' grave at the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina. He asked his children and bodyguard to go ahead and wait for him in the car, before shooting himself in the chest near the heart. He was rushed to Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City, but was declared dead on arrival and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. The cause of his suicide ranges from pressure from the media and the senators taking the questions to a personal level and his connection to the Arroyo administration, with one senator calling him \"gutless coward\". A cemetery caretaker who was present nearby and witnessed the suicide, was stated to have overheard Reyes\\' last words \"I\\'m sorry\". Reyes was buried on February 13, 2011, with full military honours at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Metro Manila. ==Awards== * 35px Presidential Medal of Merit (Philippines) * 35px Disaster Relief & Rehabilitation Operation Ribbon * 35px Anti-dissidence Campaign Medal * 35px Luzon Anti Dissidence Campaign Medal * 35px Visayas Anti-Dissidence Campaign Medal * 35px Mindanao Anti-dissidence Campaign Medal * 35px Long Service Medal * 35px Military Commendation Medal * 35px Military Civic Action Medal * 35px Silver Wing Medal * 35px Distinguished Service Star ==References== ==External links== Category:1945 births Category:2011 deaths Category:2011 suicides Category:Arroyo administration cabinet members Category:Asian Institute of Management alumni Category:Burials at the Libingan ng mga Bayani Category:Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs (Philippines) Category:Estrada administration personnel Category:Filipino generals Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Lakandula Category:Harvard Kennedy School alumni Category:Military personnel who died by suicide Category:Northeastern Illinois University alumni Category:People from San Miguel, Manila Category:Philippine Military Academy alumni Category:Politicians who died by suicide Category:Recipients of Gawad sa Kaunlaran Category:Secretaries of National Defense of the Philippines Category:Secretaries of the Interior and Local Government of the Philippines Category:Secretaries of Energy of the Philippines Category:Secretaries of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines Category:Suicides by firearm in the Philippines'\n",

It has been reported that in one case a television station was able to show millions of viewers a ShakeMap for an earthquake that had occurred only six minutes earlier .) information to emergency responders and officials, the news media, and the public.; . Such information is used to anticipate the likely severity and extent of damage, and to guide decisions on the responses needed.. Data is collected by eleven regional seismic networks and the National Seismic Network (\"ANSS backbone\") of dedicated stations, with additional inputs from overseas seismic networks. Analysis is done at the regional data centers, and at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC),. with the results posted at the USGS earthquake web page (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/). The National Strong Motion Project of the ANSS has instrumented 168 structures to record their response to very strong shaking. This data is used in research on earthquake-resistant engineering.. == Products and services == The ANSS provides a range of products and services:. * Immediate notification of earthquakes to government and emergency managers. * Earthquake Notification Service (ENS): customized notifications via e-mail and text messages. * ShakeMap: a map of the anticipated severity and extent of ground shaking, based on the measured strength of ground shaking and known characteristics of the affected locality. * ShakeCast: automated delivery of ShakeMaps customized for critical infrastructure, providing an estimate of shaking experienced. * Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER): combines ShakeMap results with an inventory of buildings and construction types to provide an immediate estimate of * Did-You-Feel-It? (DYFI): crowd-sourced reports of shaking that augment and interpolate instrumental data. * The ANSS Comprehensive Catalog (ComCat) is a repository of data from the participating seismic networks.

            " 'Abdurrahman Pasha High School (Ottoman: كاستامونو صولتانيسي, كاستامونو ايداديسي; Turkish: Abdurrahmanpaşa Lisesi, Kastamonu İdadisi) is the first official high school opened in Anatolia in 1885. == Founding == Abdurrahman Nureddin Pasha, who served as the grand vizier for two months and eleven days between May 2, 1882 - July 12, 1882, started his studies by thinking that the region needed educational reforms just like in Istanbul, while he was the Governor of Kastamonu. As a result of his studies, he decided to establish a high school. == Construction == Kastamonu Abdurrahman Pasha High School served together with the Military High School at the time it was founded and consisted of two classes. In 1888, the number of classes was 3, and at the beginning of 1891–1892, the number of classes was 5. At the same time, the school has been converted into a boarding dormitory. It prevented slipping by placing the facade of the building facing the stream on solid foundations. Thousand Ottoman Golds were spent on this work alone. Abdurrahman Pasha took a close interest in the construction of the High School building, collected 8500 gold lira, which is necessary for the entire building, from the public, and expenditures were made by a commission formed from the public. The School Building was completed in 4 years. After the declaration of the second constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire, many high schools were changed to \"Sultani\". Abdurrahman Pasha High School is one of these high schools. == New Building == The number of students coming from the surrounding provinces of Abdurrahman Pasha High School increased, and it could not respond to the students who wanted to come to the school. Since the need to construct an additional building arose, the houses facing Atatürk Street on the creek side of the High School building were expropriated and the construction of the middle section was started on September 29, 1937, in accordance with the project received from the Ministry. This building consists of 10 classrooms, 2 laboratories, 1 conference hall, 1 dining hall and 1 cupboard, and is currently used as the second high school building. == Directorate == After Birol Yılmaz, who was the principal of Abdurrahman Pasha High School for 6 years, died at the age of 57 due to coronavirus, Hüseyin Mısırlıoğlu was appointed to this task. There are also three assistant principals: * Harun Kartal * Muhammet Ercan Irgat * Ayten Canarslan == Gallipoli Campaign Martyrs == In 1915, 67 students from Abdurrahman Pasha High School, 63 of whom were from high school and 4 from the middle school, were sent to the Gallipoli and Caucasus fronts as soldiers. 13 students, 8 from high school and 5 from middle school, who joined the army in 1916, fought in different fronts of the First World War. Since 1916-1917 and October 1917, at least 30 students who were trained under the military law were conscripted into the military. Thus, the number of students from Abdurrahman Pasha High School who participated in the First World War reached at least 120. Abdurrahman Pasha High School could not graduate any of its students in the academic years of 1916-1917 and 1917-1918 due to the fact that all of its students and some teachers left the school and went to the front. == References == Category:High schools in Turkey Category:Kastamonu Category:1885 establishments in the Ottoman Empire'\n",
            " 'In mathematical optimization, the active-set method is an algorithm used to identify the active constraints in a set of inequality constraints. The active constraints are then expressed as equality constraints, thereby transforming an inequality-constrained problem into a simpler equality-constrained subproblem. An optimization problem is defined using an objective function to minimize or maximize, and a set of constraints : g_1(x) \\\\ge 0, \\\\dots, g_k(x) \\\\ge 0 that define the feasible region, that is, the set of all x to search for the optimal solution. Given a point x in the feasible region, a constraint : g_i(x) \\\\ge 0 is called active at x_0 if g_i(x_0) = 0, and inactive at x if g_i(x_0) > 0. Equality constraints are always active. The active set at x_0 is made up of those constraints g_i(x_0) that are active at the current point . The active set is particularly important in optimization theory, as it determines which constraints will influence the final result of optimization. For example, in solving the linear programming problem, the active set gives the hyperplanes that intersect at the solution point. In quadratic programming, as the solution is not necessarily on one of the edges of the bounding polygon, an estimation of the active set gives us a subset of inequalities to watch while searching the solution, which reduces the complexity of the search. ==Active-set methods== In general an active-set algorithm has the following structure: : Find a feasible starting point : repeat until \"optimal enough\" :: solve the equality problem defined by the active set (approximately) :: compute the Lagrange multipliers of the active set :: remove a subset of the constraints with negative Lagrange multipliers :: search for infeasible constraints : end repeat Methods that can be described as active-set methods include: * Successive linear programming (SLP) * Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) * Sequential linear-quadratic programming (SLQP) * Reduced gradient method (RG) * Generalized reduced gradient method (GRG) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Optimization algorithms and methods'\n",

John Murray, London. xix + 592 pp. is a genus of ptychopariid trilobite belonging to the Family Olenidae, Suborder olenina. It lived during the Tremadocian Stage, lowermost of the two standard worldwide divisions forming the Lower Ordovician Series and lowest of the seven stages within the Ordovician System. It encompasses all rocks formed during Tremadocian times, which spanned the interval between 485.4 million and 477.7 million years ago. Fossilized remains of Angelina are known from Wales, Central and South America. It differs from most other Triarthrinae in being larger, with a relatively narrow glabella, the occipital ring poorly defined, and lateral glabellar furrows relatively obscure. Eyes are placed midlength that of the cephalon and the facial sutures converge on the front border at the midline. Species also have long genal spines. The type species, Angelina sedgwickii Salter, 1859, was named for the Revd. Adam Sedgwick, the 19th Century Cambridge geologist who coined the term \"Cambrian\". This is the classic trilobite species found at Y Garth Hill, near Porthmadog, North West Wales (), and which has been collected for well over 100 years.
